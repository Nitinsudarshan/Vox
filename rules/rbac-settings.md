# RBAC — Not Built, and Why

NGConnect's `rbac-settings.md` described a granular, resource-based RBAC
system (role/team/user-level overrides, a permission-resource registry, a
management UI). **Vox does not have this, and shouldn't get it yet.**

## Why this is deliberately absent

- The primary-user framing in `docs/decisions.md` is the builder
  themselves, personal use — a single-user product has nothing for RBAC to
  gate.
- A team/enterprise, mutual-sharing model was raised as a real future
  direction (logged in `maybe_later.md`, not `docs/decisions.md` — it is
  deferred, not decided) but is explicitly **not scoped** — building
  permission infrastructure now would be exactly the kind of "design for
  hypothetical future requirements" the build prompt's operating mode
  argues against.

## If the team/sharing direction is ever picked up

Decision 12's hybrid-mode auth foundation (real login against a cloud
backend) is a reasonable base to extend — accounts already exist once
that's built, which is most of what a future permission system would need
to attach to. Revisit this file, and likely reintroduce something closer to
NGConnect's actual RBAC shape, only once that direction becomes a real,
scoped decision — not before.
