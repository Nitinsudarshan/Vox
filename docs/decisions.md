# Vox — Architectural & Product Decision Log

This log records material architectural, technical, and product decisions for Vox in the standard format specified by the project rules.

---

### Decision 1: Build Path & Relationship to Mnemos
- **Context**: Need to determine codebase origin and relationship to prior prototypes or references.
- **Decision made**: Build Vox completely from scratch in this brand-new repository. No code copied or forked from Mnemos or Meetily.
- **Reason**: Vox's three-surface architecture (Rust backend + Tauri desktop + Next.js web client) differs fundamental from prior prototypes. Starting clean avoids carrying over technical debt or mismatched paradigms.
- **Alternatives considered**: Forking Mnemos or adapting Meetily.
- **Impact**: Full control over component architecture, type definitions, and backend runtime.

---

### Decision 2: Technology Stack
- **Context**: Choosing backend runtime and native shell for Windows desktop capture and local execution.
- **Decision made**: Rust backend (`native/src-tauri/`) + Tauri 2.0 / React frontend (`native/src/`) for desktop, plus Next.js + Shadcn + Supabase for the web client (`web/`).
- **Reason**: Rust delivers high efficiency, native Windows audio/WASAPI capture capabilities, fast local inference orchestration, low footprint, and security.
- **Alternatives considered**: Python backend (PyInstaller / FastAPI), n8n workflow engine, Electron.
- **Impact**: Accepted learning-curve risk for Rust; zero Electron bloat on Windows.

---

### Decision 3: Hybrid Deployment Includes Web Surface
- **Context**: Primary desktop app vs remote/cloud access.
- **Decision made**: Dual-surface model: Windows native app for primary local capture & processing; web client for hybrid/cloud mode.
- **Reason**: Allows access to notes, Kanban board, and structured outputs from any browser when away from the desktop machine.
- **Alternatives considered**: Desktop-only application; tunnel access directly into Windows desktop.
- **Impact**: Requires shared data representations and synchronization via Supabase in hybrid mode.

---

### Decision 4: Cost Ceiling is a Hard Constraint
- **Context**: Monetization vs cost-to-run for personal/builder usage.
- **Decision made**: Every cloud-optional feature must function fully at $0 recurring cost using local STT (Whisper/Parakeet), Ollama, and local files.
- **Reason**: The user requires a zero-cost local baseline. Paid cloud APIs (OpenAI, Gemini, Claude) are optional toggle overlays.
- **Alternatives considered**: Cloud-first or cloud-only API design.
- **Impact**: Graceful degradation to local-only mode when offline or without API keys.

---

### Decision 5: No Meeting-Bot Architecture
- **Context**: Audio capture methodology for meetings.
- **Decision made**: Use push-to-talk / on-screen capture affordances only; do NOT build meeting bots (Zoom/Teams/Meet bot joiners).
- **Reason**: Structural legal/platform risk (e.g. BIPA lawsuits against bot services, platform restrictions on third-party bots). Local PTT audio capture is legally safe and platform-agnostic.
- **Alternatives considered**: Virtual audio cable recording or headless bot joiners.
- **Impact**: Zero meeting-bot infrastructure required; user triggers capture via hotkey or floating widget.

---

### Decision 6: Retrieval Architecture
- **Context**: Context retrieval over stored vault notes and historical transcripts.
- **Decision made**: Use embedded vector search (LanceDB) over markdown notes for MVP. Graph-based retrieval (GraphRAG) is explicitly deferred post-MVP.
- **Reason**: Vector RAG is fast, lightweight, runs embedded in Rust without separate server processes, and provides excellent results for <10,000 documents.
- **Alternatives considered**: Full Knowledge Graph / GraphRAG, plain keyword search.
- **Impact**: Simple schema with LanceDB tables storing embeddings alongside markdown note file paths.

---

### Decision 7: Kanban Delivery Scope for MVP
- **Context**: Presenting actionable items extracted from meetings.
- **Decision made**: List-to-board rendering for MVP (parsing structured lists of tasks into Kanban columns: To Do, In Progress, Done). Drag-and-drop persistence deferred post-MVP.
- **Reason**: Validates the meeting-to-task parsing pipeline first without getting bogged down in complex drag-and-drop state synchronization across files.
- **Alternatives considered**: Custom drag-and-drop board builder.
- **Impact**: Focuses engineering effort on LLM extraction reliability.

---

### Decision 8: MCP Integrations
- **Context**: External system integrations for Calendar, Notion, and Google Drive.
- **Decision made**: Reuse official/community MCP servers as-is (`nspady/google-calendar-mcp`, `makenotion/notion-mcp-server`, `isaacphi/mcp-gdrive`).
- **Reason**: No custom integration code needed for these 3 services; standard MCP client wiring in Rust handles tool execution.
- **Alternatives considered**: Building direct REST client wrappers for Google / Notion APIs.
- **Impact**: Standardization on Model Context Protocol across all trigger actions.

---

### Decision 9: No Rust-vs-Python Benchmarking Spike
- **Context**: Choice of language for audio and LLM pipeline orchestration.
- **Decision made**: Proceed directly with Rust (`native/src-tauri`). Spike comparing Python vs Rust is cancelled.
- **Reason**: Decision 2 committed to Rust for native desktop integration and memory efficiency.
- **Alternatives considered**: Python backend prototype.
- **Impact**: All backend code written in idiomatic Rust.

---

### Decision 10: Trigger Phrases are User-Customizable
- **Context**: Voice commands mapping to system actions.
- **Decision made**: Build a fully configurable trigger-phrase engine where users define custom phrase -> action mappings in a settings surface.
- **Reason**: Fixed trigger lists restrict utility. Users need tailored phrases (e.g. "Schedule sync", "Remind me to submit report", "Save note to Drive").
- **Alternatives considered**: Hardcoded list of voice command keywords.
- **Impact**: Intent classifier must match against dynamic user-configured lists and parameters.

---

### Decision 11: Target Build Environment
- **Context**: Development environment.
- **Decision made**: Target build environment is Google Antigravity.
- **Reason**: System tools, terminal, and AI pair-programming agent environment.
- **Alternatives considered**: Standard manual CLI workflow.
- **Impact**: All build and test workflows validated in Antigravity.

---

### Decision 13: Universal Dictation & Global Hotkeys
- **Context**: The original scope decided a PTT global hotkey + floating widget for Vox's *own* capture modes (meeting/scribble), but left "type transcribed speech into whatever app/field currently has OS focus" (universal dictation) and a global show/hide hotkey undecided by omission.
- **Decision made**: Add two OS-wide global hotkeys via `tauri-plugin-global-shortcut`: a show/hide toggle (default `Ctrl+Shift+Space`) and a push-to-talk universal dictation hotkey (default `Ctrl+Space`, configurable, held down to record). On release, the captured audio is transcribed (STT only, no LLM pipeline) and typed into whichever field has OS focus via the `enigo` crate's keystroke simulation — not necessarily Vox's own window. A small always-on-top, non-focus-stealing indicator window shows "🎙 Listening…" while the hotkey is held.
- **Reason**: This closes a real gap identified against competitors (Handy, VoiceInk, espanso, OpenWhispr) — dictation confined to Vox's own chat/capture UI is a materially smaller feature than typing into Slack, email, or code anywhere on the machine. Vox's existing Rust/Tauri/cpal audio pipeline made this cheaper to add natively than it would be to bolt onto a Python-backed app (no JS `MediaRecorder` bridging needed — the OS-hotkey handler calls the same `AudioRecorder`/`SttEngine` used elsewhere in Rust directly).
- **Alternatives considered**: Confining dictation to Vox's own window only (rejected — doesn't solve the "type into Slack/email/code" use case that makes dictation tools useful); a JS-side `MediaRecorder`-in-hidden-window approach as used by prior Tauri prototypes (rejected — unnecessary indirection given capture already happens in Rust).
- **Impact**: New `native/src-tauri/src/hotkeys/` module (global shortcut registration, indicator window lifecycle, `injection.rs` for `enigo` text injection). `AudioRecorder::start`/`stop` are called directly from the hotkey handler, bypassing Tauri IPC entirely for this flow.

---

### Decision 14: Real Local Speech-to-Text (whisper-rs)
- **Context**: `capture::AudioRecorder` originally returned a hardcoded placeholder transcript string — real STT was never wired up, and `start()` didn't actually record audio either (it created an empty WAV file). Universal dictation and voice chat both need real transcription to be meaningful.
- **Decision made**: Implement real microphone capture via `cpal` (resampled to 16kHz mono) and real local transcription via `whisper-rs` (Rust bindings to whisper.cpp), loading a user-configured GGML model path (`stt.whisper_model_path` in settings). No model ships in the repo — the user downloads one (e.g. from `ggerganov/whisper.cpp` on Hugging Face) and points Vox at it.
- **Reason**: Upholds Decision 4 (zero recurring cost) and Decision 6/product.md's "local STT (Parakeet/Whisper)" commitment for real, not just in the docs. whisper.cpp via `whisper-rs` needs no Python runtime, matching Decision 2's from-scratch-Rust commitment.
- **Alternatives considered**: A Python/faster-whisper sidecar process (rejected — reintroduces the Python dependency Decision 1/2 deliberately avoided); a cloud STT fallback as the default (rejected — would violate the zero-cost-by-default baseline; cloud STT remains a future option, not implemented here).
- **Impact**: `capture::stt::SttEngine` lazily loads and caches the whisper.cpp context; `AudioRecorder` now performs a real dedicated-thread `cpal` capture instead of writing an empty WAV placeholder.

---

### Decision 15: In-App Voice Chat, Grounded in Vault Notes (RAG-lite for now)
- **Context**: Neither the original decisions nor the docs described a conversational "record → transcribe → answer → speak back" surface — vector search (Decision 6) was scoped as an internal retrieval-cost optimization, not a user-facing Q&A feature.
- **Decision made**: Add a "Voice Chat" tab: record a spoken question, transcribe it, retrieve the most relevant vault notes, ask the configured LLM provider for an answer grounded in those notes (with source titles shown), and optionally speak the answer back via a local TTS engine. Retrieval currently uses simple term-overlap scoring over vault note content (`VaultManager::search_notes`), explicitly as a stand-in for the embedded LanceDB vector search Decision 6 already commits to — that embedding pipeline is tracked as backlog (see `docs/roadmap.md`), not implemented in this round.
- **Reason**: This was explicitly requested as core product behavior ("voice input inside the app: record → transcribe → answer → speak back") and is a natural extension of Decision 6's vault-grounded-retrieval commitment. Shipping a real (if simple) retrieval step now, rather than mocking the whole feature, keeps the answers honestly grounded instead of faking groundedness.
- **Alternatives considered**: Waiting for the full LanceDB embedding pipeline before shipping any chat UI (rejected — would block a requested feature on unrelated, larger infrastructure work); ungrounded chat with no vault retrieval (rejected — contradicts Vox's core "grounded in your own notes" positioning).
- **Impact**: New `pipeline::chat::process_chat` function and `VaultManager::search_notes`/`list_notes`. Chat mode reuses the existing `start_capture`/`stop_capture` commands (mode `"chat"`) rather than adding a parallel command surface, and skips trigger-phrase matching (a question containing "remind me" shouldn't be hijacked into firing a reminder).

---

### Decision 16: Optional Local Text-to-Speech (Piper)
- **Context**: product.md's stack references Piper TTS, but no code path ever called it; "speak back" was undecided.
- **Decision made**: Add `tts::TtsEngine`, which shells out to a user-configured Piper binary + voice model to synthesize the voice chat answer as WAV audio, returned to the frontend as base64 and played via a standard HTML `<audio>` element. If either path is unconfigured, this silently degrades to text-only rather than failing the chat response.
- **Reason**: Keeps "speak back" zero-cost and local (Piper is free/local, per the original Technology Stacks research), while not making it a hard requirement — voice chat is fully usable without it.
- **Alternatives considered**: A cloud TTS API as the default (rejected — violates zero-cost-by-default); making Piper mandatory for voice chat to function (rejected — unnecessarily blocks a text-based answer on an optional nicety).
- **Impact**: New `native/src-tauri/src/tts/` module. `ProcessedPipelineResult` gains `sources: Vec<String>` and `spoken_audio_base64: Option<String>` fields (empty/`None` for the pre-existing meeting/scribble modes).

---

### Decision 17: Hybrid-Mode Architecture
- **Context**: Auth and data storage model when hybrid mode is active.
- **Decision made**: Use cloud storage (Supabase PostgreSQL + RLS + real password/token auth) for hybrid mode, NOT remote/tunnel access to the local desktop.
- **Reason**: Remote tunneling introduces network complexity, firewall issues, and desktop uptime dependencies. Cloud BaaS ensures reliable web access. Supabase auto-pause is mitigated with client-side status checks.
- **Alternatives considered**: Tailscale/ngrok tunnel to local machine; custom auth server.
- **Impact**: Clear separation: local mode uses Markdown vault + LanceDB; hybrid mode syncs to Supabase.

---

### Decision 18 (PTT-001): Preserve Backend Ownership of Capture State
- **Context**: UI floating dictation pill overlay redesign vs backend capture state management.
- **Decision made**: Rust backend (`AudioRecorder`, `hotkeys/mod.rs`, `commands.rs`) remains the single source of truth for capture session state.
- **Reason**: Prevents UI/backend state drift, duplicate capture triggers, or lost recording sessions.
- **Alternatives considered**: Frontend-owned `isRecording` state in React.
- **Impact**: React floating pill acts strictly as a consumer of backend events (`capture-state-changed`, `capture-level`).

---

### Decision 19 (PTT-002): Reuse Existing AudioRecorder
- **Context**: Push-to-talk pill overlay recording logic.
- **Decision made**: The floating pill overlay must consume the existing `AudioRecorder` rather than initializing a separate recording pipeline.
- **Reason**: Avoids duplicate microphone capture threads, resource contention, and session conflicts.
- **Impact**: Shared session management across global hotkeys and UI affordances.

---

### Decision 20 (PTT-003): Reuse Existing Local whisper-rs STT
- **Context**: Speech transcription for push-to-talk dictation.
- **Decision made**: PTT dictation uses Vox's existing local `whisper-rs` STT pipeline (with heuristic fallback when unconfigured).
- **Reason**: Preserves zero-cost local operation and offline privacy commitments.
- **Impact**: Fast local transcription without external API dependencies.

---

### Decision 21 (PTT-004): Floating Pill as Control/Presentation Surface Only
- **Context**: Responsibility boundary for floating dictation pill.
- **Decision made**: The pill window is purely a presentation and control surface. A UI crash, hide, or unmount must never corrupt active capture or text injection.
- **Reason**: Decouples UI overlay rendering from background audio recording and OS focus injection.
- **Impact**: Dictation completes reliably even if the overlay window is minimized or hidden.

---

### Decision 22 (PTT-005): Preserve Global Push-to-Talk Hotkey Interaction
- **Context**: Interaction model for OS-wide dictation.
- **Decision made**: Press-and-hold global hotkey (`Ctrl+Space`) with release-triggered text injection remains the primary interaction model.
- **Reason**: Delivers fast, frictionless universal dictation across all desktop applications.
- **Impact**: Native `tauri-plugin-global-shortcut` press/release handlers remain core trigger paths.

---

### Decision 23 (PTT-006): Secondary Click-to-Talk Affordance
- **Context**: Mouse-driven dictation trigger on floating pill overlay.
- **Decision made**: Support click-to-talk on the floating pill using the exact same backend state machine.
- **Reason**: Provides accessibility and mouse convenience without introducing parallel state pipelines.
- **Impact**: Prevents simultaneous mouse/keyboard capture sessions via backend session locks.

---

### Decision 24 (PTT-007): Zero OS Focus Theft
- **Context**: Window focus management during text injection.
- **Decision made**: The floating dictation pill overlay must never steal OS window focus (`focused(false)`, `always_on_top(true)`, `skip_taskbar(true)`).
- **Reason**: OS text injection via `enigo` relies on preserving the user's active application target (Chrome, VS Code, Slack, Notepad, etc.).
- **Impact**: Transcribed text reliably lands in the user's target input field.

---

### Decision 25 (PTT-008): Compact State Visualization Over Live Transcripts
- **Context**: On-screen overlay content during speech capture.
- **Decision made**: The floating pill communicates state (`IDLE` → `LISTENING` → `TRANSCRIBING` → `SUCCESS` / `ERROR`) and live audio level rather than streaming raw transcripts.
- **Reason**: Keeps overlay compact (~420x72px), non-distracting, and privacy-preserving.
- **Impact**: Minimal visual footprint on desktop.

---

### Decision 26 (PTT-009): Real Audio RMS Level Waveform
- **Context**: Visual feedback during active microphone recording.
- **Decision made**: Drive the listening waveform from real-time Root Mean Square (RMS) audio level metrics calculated in Rust and emitted at ~25Hz.
- **Reason**: Gives immediate, tactile visual confirmation of microphone pickup without IPC bloat.
- **Impact**: Emits lightweight `{ level: f32 }` payload every 40ms during recording.

---

### Decision 27 (PTT-010): Structured Capture Event Architecture
- **Context**: Event payload format for `capture-state-changed`.
- **Decision made**: Extend `capture-state-changed` events with structured state machine status (`IDLE`, `STARTING`, `LISTENING`, `STOPPING`, `TRANSCRIBING`, `PROCESSING`, `INJECTING`, `SUCCESS`, `ERROR`, `CANCELLED`, `NO_SPEECH`).
- **Reason**: Provides complete state synchronization across all application windows.
- **Impact**: Single unified state event schema for desktop overlay and main window.

---

### Decision 28 (PTT-011): Defer Dictation Indicator Consolidation
- **Context**: Coexistence of `dictation-pill` and `dictation-indicator` windows.
- **Decision made**: Preserve `dictation-indicator` until the upgraded `dictation-pill` passes full regression testing across all platforms.
- **Reason**: Avoids breaking existing shortcut flows during transition.
- **Impact**: Safe, incremental migration to unified pill overlay.

---

### Decision 29 (PTT-012): Defer Active-Monitor Utility Positioning
- **Context**: Multi-monitor overlay placement.
- **Decision made**: Use bottom-center primary monitor positioning for MVP, deferring active-window monitor auto-detection to post-MVP utility.
- **Reason**: Focuses immediate scope on core PTT reliability and focus preservation.
- **Impact**: Clean, predictable default overlay placement across single and multi-monitor setups.

---

### Decision 30 (PTT-013): Supersede Decision 28 — Remove `dictation-indicator`, Single-Window RESTING/EXPANDED Pill
- **Context**: In practice, having both `dictation-indicator` (a hardcoded solid-red "🎙 Listening…" box, shown/hidden directly by the hotkey handler) and `dictation-pill` (which independently reacts to the same `capture-state-changed` event) meant Ctrl+Space produced two separate, uncoordinated visual surfaces at once — confusing, and not what was asked for. The pill was also a single fixed-size (420×72) window at all times, so its fully-transparent, click-through-unaware bounds around a compact idle state were larger than the visible content, which is exactly what causes clicks meant for whatever's underneath to land on the invisible overlay instead, and would clip/hide any future dialog that overflowed those fixed bounds.
- **Decision made**: Remove `dictation-indicator` entirely (window creation, show/hide calls, the component, its hash route, `INDICATOR_WINDOW_LABEL`) — verified nothing else in the codebase referenced it. `dictation-pill` is now the *only* PTT visual surface, with one native window and one presentation state machine: RESTING (compact, e.g. ~56×56) or EXPANDED (~420×72, the listening/processing/success/error body). Ctrl+Space and hovering the resting pill both expand it (backend capture events and local hover state respectively); releasing/mouse-away collapses it back. The frontend reports its own RESTING/EXPANDED choice to Rust via a new `set_pill_expanded` command, which resizes *and* re-anchors the native window to tightly match — never a bigger invisible hit-region than what's actually visible.
- **Reason**: This is what was actually asked for (one PTT surface, not two), and closes the invisible-overlay class of bug (stray click-throughs, potential dialog clipping) at the architecture level rather than patching it with CSS z-index, which can't affect native window ordering or hit-testing at all.
- **Alternatives considered**: Keeping `dictation-indicator` as a fallback for the (now nonexistent) case where the pill fails to load (rejected — adds a second surface back for a case that's already handled by the pill's own error phase); resizing the pill window continuously to match arbitrary content width (rejected as unnecessary complexity — two fixed sizes cover every current phase's content).
- **Impact**: `hotkeys/mod.rs` loses `INDICATOR_WINDOW_LABEL`, `ensure_indicator_window`, `compute_bottom_right_position`, `show_indicator`, `hide_indicator`, and the `WebviewUrl`/`WebviewWindowBuilder` imports they needed. `DictationIndicator.tsx` and its `#/dictation-indicator` route are deleted.

---

### Decision 31 (PTT-014): Work-Area-Aware, Cursor-Monitor-Relative Pill Positioning
- **Context**: The original `compute_bottom_center_position`/`compute_bottom_right_position` hardcoded `screen_height - pill_height - 48` off the *primary* monitor's full size (not its usable work area), which would sit the pill on top of a taskbar rather than above it, ignore auto-hide taskbars, and always use the primary monitor regardless of which one the user was actually on.
- **Decision made**: Position the pill using Tauri's `Monitor::work_area()` (the OS-reported usable desktop region, which already excludes a fixed taskbar/dock and adapts to an auto-hidden one — no taskbar height is ever hardcoded) of whichever monitor is currently under the OS cursor (`AppHandle::cursor_position` + `monitor_from_point`), falling back to the primary monitor if that lookup fails. Add a `UiSettings.pill_position` (`BottomCenter` | `TopCenter` | `LeftCenter` | `RightCenter`) anchor choice, exposed in Settings. Position is recomputed from scratch every time the pill is shown or resized (rather than cached), which is what actually keeps it correct across monitor changes, resolution changes, DPI changes, and position-setting changes without needing a live monitor-hotplug subscription Tauri's public API doesn't expose.
- **Reason**: Matches how OS-native flyout/notification widgets behave, and closes the "sits under the taskbar" / "wrong monitor" class of bug at the source instead of adding more hardcoded offsets.
- **Alternatives considered**: Tracking the foreground application's window/monitor directly (rejected — Tauri has no cross-platform public API for "which window is focused system-wide," so the cursor's monitor, which is where the user's attention almost always already is, is the closest available proxy); a persistent monitor-configuration watcher (rejected — recomputing on every show/resize is simpler and covers the same cases in practice, since the pill isn't visible/interactable in between).
- **Impact**: `overlay.rs`'s `compute_anchor`/`active_monitor` replace the old primary-monitor-only math. `PillPosition` lives in `settings::mod` (persisted) and is threaded through `ensure_pill_window`, `set_expanded`, and the new `set_pill_position`/`reposition_pill` command/function.

---

### Decision 32: Desktop-First Scope Reduction — Web Surface Deferred (Scope-Reduction Set 1)
- **Context**: Vox's active product is being reduced to a single, stable, desktop-first surface: global PTT + click-to-talk + local STT + text injection through one Dictation Pill. A repository audit (Scope-Reduction Set 0, 2026-08-20) confirmed `web/` (the Next.js dashboard) has zero import, build, or runtime coupling to `native/` — no shared workspace config, no path references in either direction, and the "desktop app syncs vault notes to Supabase" claim in `docs/architecture.md` has no corresponding implementation anywhere in `native/src-tauri` (a case-insensitive grep for "supabase" across the entire Rust backend returns zero matches, and there is no Supabase/Postgres crate dependency). `web/`'s own Supabase client is itself a `MockSupabaseClient` returning hardcoded data, and its auth layer returns a hardcoded dummy user — the web surface's own hybrid-sync code is a stub, not just disconnected from the desktop app.
- **Decision made**: Web is deferred for the current product phase. Its implementation is preserved untouched under `web/`; it is removed from active MVP scope in `docs/product.md` and `docs/requirements.md`, and its presence in `docs/architecture.md`'s three-surface diagram is annotated as deferred rather than redrawn.
- **Reason**: The Web surface adds zero risk to remove from active scope because it was never wired into the desktop build in the first place — there is no navigation entry, startup path, build step, or IPC surface in `native/` referencing it. Preserving the implementation costs nothing; rebuilding, migrating, or dismantling it would be pure wasted effort against a surface that isn't part of the current MVP.
- **Existing Functionality Preserved**: All of `web/`'s existing code, and all of `native/`'s existing functionality (PTT, click-to-talk, capture, STT, injection, Kanban, Voice Chat, Triggers, Settings), is completely unchanged. Nothing was deleted, migrated, or refactored.
- **Explicitly Not Changed**: No files under `web/`. No Rust or TypeScript code under `native/`. No settings, commands, build configuration, or CI.
- **Deferred**: The entire `web/` surface — Next.js dashboard, Supabase-backed hybrid auth/sync (not yet implemented on either side), and any future "access notes/Kanban from a browser" functionality — remains available to resume later, unmodified.
- **Supersedes**: Decision 3 ("Hybrid Deployment Includes Web Surface") is superseded for the current desktop-first MVP phase only — not deleted or invalidated as history. Dual-surface hybrid deployment may be resumed in a future phase; this decision does not rule it out permanently.

---

### Decision 33: Desktop-First Scope Reduction — Kanban Deferred (Scope-Reduction Set 2)
- **Context**: Continuing the desktop-first scope reduction (Decision 32), a repository audit found Kanban's own feeder pipeline (`PipelineEngine::process_meeting`, matched on `mode:"meeting"`) is already unreachable in the running app — no frontend code path sets that mode since the PTT redesign collapsed capture into one mode-less Dictation Pill. `KanbanBoard.tsx` was reachable only via its own sidebar nav tab (not the default view), and its backend read path (`get_kanban_cards` → `VaultManager::list_kanban_cards`) is cleanly isolated from the vault/notes machinery Scribble Notes and Voice Chat actually use.
- **Decision made**: Remove Kanban's active navigation from `native/src/App.tsx`: the sidebar "Kanban Board" nav button, the `kanban` branch of the tab switcher and hero header, the `kanban` value from the `navigate-tab` event allowlist, and the unconditional `get_kanban_cards` fetch that previously ran on every app launch regardless of whether Kanban was ever opened. `KanbanBoard.tsx`, the `KanbanCard` type, and the backend `get_kanban_cards` command / `VaultManager` Kanban read/write methods are all left fully intact and untouched.
- **Reason**: This is the "Option 1 — remove active surface only" path the scope-reduction process prefers: no code needed to change inside the Kanban implementation itself, because its only active-surface footprint was `App.tsx`'s navigation and an unconditional startup fetch. Removing the startup fetch also resolves the one flagged "required at startup" concern from the Set 0 audit.
- **Existing Functionality Preserved**: `KanbanBoard.tsx` (unmodified), the `KanbanCard` type in `types/index.ts` (unmodified, still used by `KanbanBoard.tsx`), the `get_kanban_cards` Tauri command, and `VaultManager`'s Kanban card read/write methods and `.Vox/vault/kanban/` storage — all unchanged and available to reconnect later.
- **Explicitly Not Changed**: No Rust code. No settings (Kanban had none). Scribble Notes, Voice Chat, PTT, click-to-talk, hotkeys, STT, and text injection — untouched.
- **Deferred**: The Kanban board UI and its meeting-transcript-to-task-card pipeline concept, resumable by re-adding the nav entry and (separately, if ever needed) wiring a UI path that sets `mode:"meeting"` again.
- **Supersedes**: Decision 7 ("Kanban Delivery Scope for MVP") is superseded for the current desktop-first MVP phase only — not deleted or invalidated as history.

---

### Decision 34: Desktop-First Scope Reduction — Voice Chat & TTS Deferred (Scope-Reduction Set 3)
- **Context**: Continuing the desktop-first scope reduction (Decisions 32–33), the Set 0 audit confirmed Voice Chat is fully implemented and active — `ChatPanel.tsx`, wired into `App.tsx`'s "Voice Chat" nav tab, backed by real `pipeline::chat::process_chat` (vault-grounded retrieval + LLM answer + optional TTS) — contrary to an initial assumption that it might not exist. TTS (`tts::TtsEngine`, shelling out to a user-configured Piper binary) has exactly one call site in the entire backend: `pipeline::chat::process_chat`. The audit also confirmed `providers::LLMClient` (the shared Ollama/cloud client) is used identically by Voice Chat, the Kanban/meeting pipeline, and Scribble Notes — it is genuinely shared infrastructure, not something Voice Chat owns.
- **Decision made**: Remove Voice Chat's active navigation from `native/src/App.tsx` (sidebar "Voice Chat" nav button, the `chat` tab-switch/hero-header branch, `chat` from the `navigate-tab` allowlist), the same pattern used for Kanban in Decision 33. Additionally remove the Piper TTS configuration block from `native/src/components/settings/ProviderSettings.tsx` (General section) — its only stated purpose, per its own caption text, was to "skip 'speak back' in voice chat," so it is Voice Chat's settings surface, not an independent one. `ChatPanel.tsx`, `pipeline::chat::process_chat`, `tts::TtsEngine`, and `providers::LLMClient` are left fully untouched.
- **Reason**: Per the scope-reduction rules, TTS is removed only if it has no active consumer and removal is low-risk; `process_chat` (preserved code) still calls it, so the module itself is not removed, only its UI entry points (Voice Chat's tab and its settings block) — this makes both features unreachable from the UI without touching any Rust code or the shared LLM client Kanban/meeting and Scribble Notes depend on.
- **Existing Functionality Preserved**: `ChatPanel.tsx`, `pipeline::chat::process_chat`, `tts::TtsEngine`, `providers::LLMClient` (used identically by the in-scope Kanban/meeting and Scribble pipelines), and the `TtsSettings`/`AppSettings.tts` struct fields and their load/save round-trip — all unchanged.
- **Explicitly Not Changed**: No Rust code. `DEFAULT_SETTINGS.tts` and the `AppSettings`/`ProcessedPipelineResult` TypeScript types in `types/index.ts` are unchanged (still needed for settings round-tripping and by `ChatPanel.tsx` itself). Kanban, PTT, click-to-talk, hotkeys, STT, and text injection — untouched.
- **Deferred**: The Voice Chat tab, its "speak back" TTS configuration UI, and the underlying vault-grounded Q&A + optional-speech feature — resumable by re-adding the nav entry and settings block.
- **Supersedes**: Decision 15 ("In-App Voice Chat, Grounded in Vault Notes") and Decision 16 ("Optional Local Text-to-Speech (Piper)") are superseded for the current desktop-first MVP phase only — not deleted or invalidated as history.

### Decision 35: Desktop-First Scope Reduction — Triggers/MCP Deferred (Scope-Reduction Set 4)
- **Context**: Continuing the desktop-first scope reduction (Decisions 32–34), the Set 0 audit found Triggers/MCP genuinely coupled to the core capture path, not just to a settings screen: `TriggerEngine::match_transcript`/`McpRouter::dispatch_action` ran inline inside `process_captured_audio` (the function backing click-to-talk's "scribble" mode) for any capture whose mode wasn't `"chat"` — meaning a spoken phrase matching one of the two *enabled-by-default* triggers ("schedule meeting", "remind me to") would silently short-circuit click-to-talk dictation into a canned MCP-stub reply instead of running the normal cleanup pipeline, on every fresh install, not only for users who had configured their own triggers. `TriggerSettings.tsx` was also reachable from two places: `App.tsx`'s own "Trigger Phrases" tab, and a redundant "Triggers & MCP" sub-section inside `ProviderSettings.tsx`'s own settings sub-nav.
- **Decision made**: Remove both active entry points to `TriggerSettings.tsx` (the `App.tsx` top-level tab and the `ProviderSettings.tsx` sub-nav section). Remove the inline trigger-match-and-MCP-dispatch block from `process_captured_audio` in `native/src-tauri/src/commands.rs`, so capture processing falls straight through to the mode-based pipeline dispatch (meeting/chat/scribble) exactly as it would for any transcript that didn't match a trigger. `TriggerEngine`, `McpRouter`, and the `get_triggers`/`save_triggers` Tauri commands are left completely intact — only their automatic invocation inside the core capture path is removed, not the modules themselves.
- **Reason**: Per the scope-reduction rules, active entry points for a feature not required by core should be removed; the settings UI was the obvious entry point, but the audit specifically flagged the inline dispatch as a second, more consequential one — it executed automatically on the core dictation path with no way for a user to see or control it once the settings UI is gone, which is precisely the "accidentally triggered by the core workflow" state the rules prohibit for deferred functionality. `TriggerEngine`/`McpRouter` are not constructed as app-wide state (no `.manage()` entry in `lib.rs`) and were used only from the two now-removed call sites, so this is a self-contained, low-risk removal.
- **Existing Functionality Preserved**: `native/src-tauri/src/triggers/mod.rs` (`TriggerEngine`, unmodified, including its unit tests), `native/src-tauri/src/mcp/mod.rs` (`McpRouter`, unmodified), the `get_triggers`/`save_triggers` Tauri commands, and `TriggerSettings.tsx` itself — all unchanged and available to reconnect later.
- **Explicitly Not Changed**: PTT, click-to-talk's capture/transcription steps, hotkeys, STT, text injection, Kanban, Voice Chat, Scribble Notes, and every setting other than the two Triggers nav entries.
- **Deferred**: Trigger-phrase configuration and MCP action dispatch — resumable by re-adding the nav entries and the `process_captured_audio` dispatch block.
- **Supersedes**: Decision 8 ("MCP Integrations") and Decision 10 ("Trigger Phrases are User-Customizable") are superseded for the current desktop-first MVP phase only — not deleted or invalidated as history.

### Decision 36: Desktop-First Scope Reduction — Single Dictation Pill, Docked/Floating Mode Removed (Scope-Reduction Set 5)
- **Context**: The Set 0 audit determined `DictationPill.tsx` is already the single canonical pill implementation — `FloatingPill.tsx` (13 lines) and `PTTWidget.tsx` are not competing implementations but two render *sites* for the same component: `FloatingPill` mounts it inside the always-on-top `dictation-pill` native window (`overlay::ensure_pill_window`), while `PTTWidget` conditionally mounted it inline in the main window's Capture tab whenever `ui.show_floating_pill` was `false` ("docked" mode). This is exactly the "Docked vs Floating" product-mode distinction this scope-reduction explicitly marks REMOVE (unlike Kanban/Voice Chat/Triggers, which are marked DEFER) — while the underlying native window behavior (transparent, always-on-top, work-area-aware positioning in `overlay.rs`) is explicitly marked KEEP.
- **Decision made**: Remove the `show_floating_pill` setting end-to-end — the `UiSettings.show_floating_pill` field (Rust struct and TypeScript type), the `set_pill_visible` Tauri command, the "Floating Dictation Pill" toggle switch in `ProviderSettings.tsx`, and `PTTWidget.tsx`'s conditional branch that rendered `DictationPill` inline as the "docked" alternative. `overlay::ensure_pill_window` is now always called with `visible: true` at startup — the floating pill window is the one, permanent PTT surface. Also removed a docked-mode-specific compensation in `hotkeys::on_dictation_pressed` (`hotkeys/mod.rs`) that showed the main window and switched it to the Capture tab so a docked pill's reaction to the hotkey would be visible — unnecessary now that the always-on-top floating pill is always present and already reacts to the same `capture-state-changed` event regardless of the main window's state. `DictationPill.tsx`, `FloatingPill.tsx`, `PillSettingsPopover.tsx`, `PillTypes.ts`, and `overlay.rs` are all completely unmodified — none of them needed to change, since the canonical pill and its native window implementation already existed and worked; only the mode-choice wrapping it was removed.
- **Reason**: `DictationPill.tsx` already was the canonical component; the only real work was collapsing two mounting strategies into one and removing the setting that chose between them — consolidation, not a rebuild.
- **Existing Functionality Preserved**: The floating pill's capture state machine, hover/click interaction, settings popover, dependency-truthfulness banners, and — critically — all of `overlay.rs`'s work-area-aware, monitor-relative, DPI-safe positioning (Decision 31/PTT-014) are completely untouched. `ui.pill_position` (the anchor-edge setting) is preserved exactly as-is.
- **Explicitly Not Changed**: `DictationPill.tsx`, `FloatingPill.tsx`, `PillSettingsPopover.tsx`, `PillTypes.ts`, `overlay.rs`, `ui.pill_position` and its `set_pill_position`/`set_pill_expanded`/`set_pill_window_mode` commands, the backend capture state machine, STT, text injection, and every deferred-feature decision from Sets 1–4.
- **Migration note**: An existing user's `settings.json` containing a stale `"show_floating_pill"` key is unaffected — `AppSettings`/`UiSettings` have no `deny_unknown_fields`, so the removed key is silently ignored on load, and it will no longer be written back on the next save.
- **Deferred vs. Removed distinction**: Unlike Decisions 32–35 (Web, Kanban, Voice Chat/TTS, Triggers/MCP — all *deferred*, implementation preserved and reconnectable), this decision is a genuine *removal* of a product concept, matching this scope reduction's own instructions ("Docked mode" and "Floating mode as a product mode" are both REMOVE targets, not DEFER targets). There is no "reconnect later" path for the setting itself, though nothing about the underlying pill or window code was deleted.
- **Open item carried forward, not resolved by this decision**: the Set 0 audit found click-to-talk (mode `"scribble"`) and the global PTT hotkey (mode `"dictation"`) diverge after transcription — only the hotkey path calls real OS text injection; click-to-talk runs the scribble LLM-cleanup/vault-write pipeline instead. This was raised repeatedly during Sets 1–4 and each time deferred rather than addressed; it remains unresolved and is orthogonal to this decision (both paths already shared the same backend capture session/state machine, which is what this decision and Decision 23/PTT-006 govern — not what happens to the transcript afterward).

### Decision 37: Toggle-to-Talk — Optional Press-Once Dictation Mode
- **Context**: The universal dictation hotkey (Ctrl+Space) is hold-to-talk by design (Decision 13/22) — press and hold to record, release to transcribe and inject. For longer dictations, holding a key down the entire time is tedious. Requested directly as a new capability, not part of the desktop-first scope reduction (Decisions 32–36).
- **Decision made**: Add `HotkeySettings.toggle_to_talk` (default `false`, preserving existing hold-to-talk behavior for everyone who doesn't opt in). When enabled, the dictation hotkey toggles: the first press starts recording, releasing the key does nothing, and a second, deliberate press stops it and runs transcription/injection exactly as a release would in hold-to-talk mode. Click-to-talk on the pill itself is unaffected — it was already toggle-based (each click flips start/stop).
- **Reason**: Directly serves the "longer audio" use case without any new recording pipeline, injection path, or capture primitive — it only changes how `hotkeys::on_dictation_pressed`/`on_dictation_released` interpret press/release events, reusing the exact same `AudioRecorder`/STT/injection flow hold-to-talk already uses.
- **Design**: A new `key_down: bool` field on the hotkey module's internal `DictationState` distinguishes a genuine second press (the deliberate "stop" signal) from the OS re-firing "pressed" repeatedly while a key stays physically held — both modes already had to filter out the latter; toggle-to-talk needed the distinction to also recognize the former. The existing 60-second "stuck session" watchdog (Decision 13, sized for hold-to-talk's short-recording assumption) would defeat the whole point of this feature if applied unchanged, so toggle-to-talk sessions get a separate, much longer 10-minute watchdog timeout instead — still a safety net against a forgotten/stuck toggle, not a normal recording-length limit.
- **Existing Functionality Preserved**: Hold-to-talk is the default and is unchanged in behavior when the setting is off (verified by tracing every press/release/repeat/watchdog case through the rewritten state machine). Click-to-talk, STT, text injection, and the capture state machine are untouched.
- **Explicitly Not Changed**: `DictationPill.tsx`'s capture-state handling, `overlay.rs`, the backend capture primitive (`AudioRecorder`), and everything from Decisions 32–36.
- **UI**: A "Toggle-to-Talk" switch in Settings → General, next to the existing hotkey recorders. `DictationPill.tsx`'s floating hint text ("Hold to record" vs "Tap to start/stop") reflects the active mode, since displaying the wrong instruction for how the feature actually behaves would violate the pill's existing dependency/behavior-truthfulness principle (Decision 25/PTT-008, now written down as the "No fake controls" rule in `rules/ui-components.md`).
- **Known edge case, accepted as low-risk**: if a user changes this setting while a toggle-to-talk session it started is still open, pressing the hotkey again does nothing until the original 10-minute watchdog for that session fires (or the user stops it via click-to-talk on the pill instead, which works independently of the hotkey module's own state tracking). This requires a specific, unlikely sequence (start a toggle recording, then open Settings and disable the mode mid-recording) and never crashes, hangs, or loses audio — accepted rather than adding further state-machine complexity for a narrow scenario.

### Decision 38: Voice Note — Universal Dictation History on the Existing Vault, Configurable Vault Directory Location

- **Context**: Decision 36's own "open item carried forward" flagged that the global dictation hotkey (mode `"dictation"`) and click-to-talk (mode `"scribble"`, via `process_captured_audio`) diverge right after transcription — only the hotkey path injects text; only click-to-talk writes a vault note — and that this was repeatedly deferred rather than resolved. Separately, a fresh audit for this feature found that Settings → "Vault & LanceDB" → "Vault Directory Location" was purely decorative: `ProviderSettings.tsx` rendered the literal string `.Vox/vault` with no `invoke()` call behind it, `AppSettings` had no field for it, and the real path was hardcoded in `lib.rs` as `std::env::current_dir().join(".Vox").join("vault")`. `tauri-plugin-dialog` was already a `Cargo.toml` dependency but never registered as a plugin or called from anywhere. LanceDB itself was confirmed not implemented at all (`VaultManager::search_notes` is keyword-overlap scoring, not vector search) — a pre-existing, unrelated gap this decision does not touch.
- **Decision made**: Made "Voice Note" the persistent history of every successful Vox transcription, stored in the existing Markdown vault as a new `note_type: "voice_note"` (`vault::VOICE_NOTE_TYPE`) — no new database, no LanceDB work, no second recorder/STT/injection/hotkey path.
  - **One funnel, both capture paths**: added `commands::save_voice_note(app, vault, transcript)`, called from both `hotkeys::stop_dictation_session` (right alongside the existing `injection::inject_text` call, independent of whether it succeeds) and `commands::process_captured_audio` (right after the existing empty-transcript guard, before the mode dispatch, skipped only for `"chat"` mode since Voice Chat is a deferred/unrelated feature per Decision 34). Each capture session already runs its stop/transcribe logic exactly once (per Decision 36's own state-machine guarantees), so this cannot double-save a transcript. The raw transcript is stored verbatim as `content` — unlike "scribble"/"meeting" notes, a Voice Note is not LLM-cleaned, since it exists to be a truthful dictation log.
  - **Vault Directory Location made real**: added `AppSettings.vault.directory: Option<String>` (persisted, `None` = unconfigured, existing default path unchanged). `VaultManager`'s internal field became `Mutex<PathBuf>` (`vault_dir()`/`set_vault_dir()`) so the running app's vault root can be repointed at runtime with no restart — every existing method kept its exact signature, so no other call site (`process_meeting`, `process_scribble`, Kanban read/write) needed to change. Registered `tauri_plugin_dialog::init()` and added three thin commands: `choose_vault_folder` (native OS folder picker via `blocking_pick_folder` on a blocking task), `get_vault_location` (reports the resolved path, the process-relative default, whether it's user-configured, and whether `VaultManager::init()` can currently access it), and `set_vault_location` (validates via a throwaway probe `VaultManager`, then repoints the live vault and persists the setting — only on success, so a bad path never disturbs a working vault).
  - **First-time setup lives on the Voice Note page, writes the one real setting**: the page calls `get_vault_location` and shows setup ("Where should Vox save your Voice Notes?"), a recovery prompt ("We can't access your Voice Note folder"), or the normal banner/stats/Transcript History view. Both "Choose Folder" and "Use Default Vox Vault" call the same `set_vault_location`, so there is exactly one authoritative setting — Settings → Vault & LanceDB now displays the real resolved path (via the same `get_vault_location`) and has its own "Choose Folder" button wired to the same commands, rather than a second, competing "Voice Note Storage Location" setting.
  - **Live updates without polling**: a new `voice-note-saved` event (payload: the saved `VaultNote`) is emitted from `save_voice_note` on every successful save; the Voice Note page's own `listen()` call prepends it to Transcript History, the same pattern `App.tsx` already used for `capture-processed`.
  - **UI terminology**: sidebar/page label changed from "Voice Capture" to "Voice Note" (the internal `activeTab` value `'capture'` was left alone — purely an implementation identifier with no functional benefit to renaming); the sidebar's redundant "MENU" caption was removed. Historical `ChangelogModal.tsx` entries that mention "the Voice Capture tab" were left as-is since they describe past releases, not current UI.
- **Reason**: This resolves Decision 36's carried-forward divergence for the one thing this task required (every successful transcript becomes a Voice Note, regardless of injection outcome) without unifying or restructuring the two capture paths themselves, which remains out of scope. Reusing `VaultNote`/`VaultManager::save_note` and the vault's existing hand-rolled frontmatter format (rather than a new schema) meant zero new persistence code; making `VaultManager` internally swappable rather than wrapping it in a new outer lock kept every existing call site untouched.
- **Existing Functionality Preserved**: Scribble Notes' LLM-cleanup pipeline, Kanban's storage layer, the Dictation Pill (component, window, state machine — completely unmodified), global PTT, click-to-talk, hotkey registration, text injection, and all prior settings all continue to work exactly as before; `cargo test`/`cargo check`/`tsc --noEmit`/`vite build` all pass. A vault with no `vault.directory` configured behaves exactly as it did before this decision (same default path, same auto-created `notes/`/`kanban/` structure).
- **Explicitly Not Changed**: Kanban, Voice Chat, Triggers/MCP navigation (still deferred per Decisions 33–35), LanceDB (still not implemented — Voice Notes use the same keyword-search-capable Markdown store as every other note type, nothing vector-related was added), and no migration of notes already on disk when a vault location changes.
- **Deferred**: Whether click-to-talk should ever also perform OS text injection (or the hotkey path should ever gain a vault-note-cleanup step) remains the same open product question Decision 36 flagged — this decision only guarantees both paths produce a Voice Note, not that they converge into one pipeline.

### Decision 39: Phase 11B — Scribbles Knowledge Layer, Provenance Model & Obsidian-Inspired Knowledge Graph

- **Context**: Need to establish Vox's persistent knowledge architecture. A Scribble is Vox's smallest persistent unit of thinking (idea, observation, question, reference, thought). The architecture strictly separates the Capture Layer (how info entered Vox: Voice, Text, File, Clipboard, Browser, Meeting), Knowledge Layer (Scribbles, Relationships, Topics, Entities, Provenance, Knowledge Graph), and Output Layer (Notes, Syntheses, Prompts, Documents, Tasks).
- **Decision made**:
  - **Zero Change to Voice Note / Capture UX**: The existing `Ctrl + Space` hotkey, Dictation Pill, Whisper STT, VAD, and Voice Note lifecycle remain 100% untouched. No second global hotkey is added. Users are never forced to choose between a Voice Note and a Scribble during capture.
  - **"Save as Scribble" Promotion**: Voice Notes can be promoted into first-class Scribbles via a dedicated "Save as Scribble" action in `VoiceNotePage.tsx`, preserving provenance to the originating Voice Note without modifying or deleting original audio/transcripts.
  - **Obsidian-Compatible Vault Storage**: Scribbles are persisted in `.Vox/vault/scribbles/<id>.md` with structured YAML frontmatter and Markdown body. Scribbles are flat, independently addressable, and survive application restarts.
  - **Asynchronous AI Enrichment**: Scribbles are persisted and displayed immediately. Non-blocking AI enrichment derives concise titles, summaries, topics, named entities, and suggested relationships in the background using `LLMClient`. All AI metadata is fully editable by the user (AI suggests, user decides).
  - **Relationship Graph Model**: Supports explicit relationship links (`RELATED_TO`, `MENTIONS`, `SAME_TOPIC`, `SAME_PROJECT`, `CONTRADICTS`, `EXTENDS`, `DERIVED_FROM`) with origin (`ai`, `user`, `system`) and confidence, connecting independent knowledge objects without auto-merging them.
  - **Obsidian-Inspired Knowledge Graph**: High-performance 2D Canvas graph with force simulation physics, circular nodes sized by connectivity/degree, subtle low-weight edges, zoom-dependent muted labels, natural dense clustering, visible orphan nodes, interactive 1-hop neighborhood highlight, node inspector panel, double-click editing, and node/orphan filtering.
- **Existing Functionality Preserved**: All Voice Note capture, STT, Dictation Pill, hotkey bindings, settings, and vault repointing continue to operate seamlessly.

---

### Decision 40: Phase 11B UX Refinement — 30-Day Trash Lifecycle, Scribble Merge Engine, Visual Connect Flow, and Obsidian Graph Controls

- **Context**: UX feedback requested refining the Phase 11B Knowledge foundation: removing internal IDs from primary badges, replacing bulky text actions with subtle icons, implementing a real 30-day soft-delete Trash lifecycle under Settings, adding first-class Scribble Merging with provenance preservation, visual candidate card selection for connecting Scribbles, adding a dedicated multi-source Capture Hub tab, flexible Split View controls, and adding Obsidian-inspired physics and display sliders to the Knowledge Graph.
- **Decision made**:
  - **Human-Readable Source Badges**: Primary UI displays clean, uppercase source chips (`VOICE NOTE`, `TEXT`, `FILE`, `CLIPBOARD`, `BROWSER`, `MEETING`) without technical UUIDs. Internal note IDs, filenames, and timestamps are exclusively accessible in an expandable "Provenance Details" section.
  - **Subtle Voice Note Promotion**: Replaced large text button with a subtle, icon-based action consistent with existing Voice Note card controls. Promoted notes display a subtle `SCRIBBLE` chip linking to the Knowledge Workspace without duplicating card content.
  - **30-Day Trash Lifecycle**: Deleted Voice Notes and Scribbles are moved to `.Vox/vault/trash/` with metadata (`deleted_at`, `expires_at`). Added Settings → "Trash & Deleted Items" surface allowing users to view days remaining, Restore items to active, permanently delete with confirmation, and Empty Trash with confirmation. Automatic expiry purges items older than 30 days.
  - **Visual Candidate Selection for Connect**: Clicking "Connect Scribble" opens a modal displaying candidate cards ranked by relevance (shared topics and entities) with search filtering and optional relationship typing, rather than abstract empty dropdowns.
  - **First-Class Scribble Merge**: Added `merge_scribbles` command creating a synthesized Scribble combining content, unioning topics/entities, linking `DERIVED_FROM` relationships to source Scribbles, setting `source_metadata.source_scribble_ids`, and running async AI enrichment without deleting original source Scribbles.
  - **Dedicated Multi-Source Capture Hub**: Moved multi-source capture into its own top-level tab (`Capture Hub`) showcasing Voice PTT (`Ctrl + Space`), direct text compose, file drag & drop (with discoverable supported formats: `.txt`, `.md`, `.json`, `.csv`, `.pdf`, `.docx`, `.png`, `.jpg`), clipboard paste, and future Browser/Meeting capture indicators.
  - **Flexible Split View**: Added collapse left, collapse right, and ratio selectors (30/70, 50/50, 70/30) with session persistence.
  - **Obsidian Graph Controls**: Added working collapsible **Display** controls (directional arrows toggle, text fade threshold slider, node size multiplier, link thickness) and **Forces** controls (center gravity, repel force, link spring force, link distance) with 60fps simulation reheating.
  - **Meaningful Title Generation**: Fallback title set to `"Generating title…"` during async AI processing, replaced upon enrichment with a 3–8 word distilled concept title rather than a truncated sentence excerpt.
- **Reason**: Elevates usability, safety, and visual polish across the Knowledge Layer without compromising Vox's core capture guarantees or local Obsidian compatibility.
- **Existing Functionality Preserved**: All Voice Note dictation, Push-to-Talk, Whisper STT, VAD, hotkeys, and vault persistence continue to operate seamlessly; all 11 backend unit tests and frontend production builds pass cleanly.

---

### Decision 41: Phase 11B UX Correction — Viewport Modals, Merge Retirement Semantics, Restored Sidenav & Exact Obsidian Graph Controls

- **Context**: Pass addressing UX interaction issues: ensuring confirmation dialogs are always rendered as viewport-level modals with backdrops and Escape key handling rather than scrollable inline elements; retiring merged source Scribbles to Trash while preserving `DERIVED_FROM` provenance; providing individual copy actions on AI exploration questions; restoring the clean 3-item Vox sidebar navigation (`capture`, `scribble`, `settings`) while embedding `Workspace`, `Capture`, `Knowledge Graph`, and `Split View` as internal sub-tabs inside Scribbles; simplifying Split View to `<` and `>` pane collapse controls; and reproducing Obsidian Graph View's exact 4-section settings hierarchy (`Filters`, `Groups`, `Display`, `Forces`) with live dynamic color grouping and real physics controls.
- **Decision made**:
  - **Viewport-Level Confirmation Modals**: Built `ConfirmationModal.tsx` rendered as a fixed overlay centered in the viewport with backdrop blur, keyboard accessibility (`Escape` closes), and clear destructive action differentiation for Delete, Permanent Delete, Empty Trash, and Merge.
  - **Merge Retirement Semantics**: Merging `A + B` creates new consolidated Scribble `C` and moves `A` and `B` into Trash (recoverable for 30 days) with `DERIVED_FROM` links, removing duplicates from the active workspace without hard deletion.
  - **Individual AI Question Copy**: Each AI exploration question features an independent copy button providing immediate checkmark feedback.
  - **Restored 3-Item Sidenav**: Restored the sidebar navigation to the 3-tab layout: `Voice Note`, `Scribble Notes`, `Settings`.
  - **Scribble Sub-Navigation**: Integrated `Workspace`, `Capture`, `Knowledge Graph`, and `Split View` inside the Scribbles surface.
  - **Simple Split View Controls**: Replaced complex resizing with simple `<` (collapse left) and `>` (collapse right) buttons and a clear restore action.
  - **Exact Obsidian Graph Settings Hierarchy**: Implemented one unified panel with 4 collapsible sections:
    - **Filters**: Search files input, `Tags` toggle, `Attachments` toggle, `Existing files only` toggle, `Orphans` toggle.
    - **Groups**: Color grouping by query with dynamic node tinting (`New group`, query input, color picker pill, remove).
    - **Display**: `Arrows` toggle, `Text fade threshold` slider, `Node size` slider, `Link thickness` slider, `Animate` reheat button.
    - **Forces**: `Center force` slider, `Repel force` slider, `Link force` slider, `Link distance` slider.
- **Reason**: Aligns Vox's knowledge interaction model with Obsidian's proven UX standards, enforces safety through viewport modals, and keeps the navigation truthful and uncluttered.
- **Existing Functionality Preserved**: All Voice Note dictation, Push-to-Talk, Whisper STT, VAD, hotkeys, and vault persistence continue to operate seamlessly; all 11 backend unit tests and frontend production builds pass cleanly.

---

### Decision 42: Phase 11B Final Merge Semantics, Active Clipboard Capture, Tag Removal & Obsidian Graph Polish

- **Context**: Final correction pass aligning merge semantics, capture layer modalities, semantic organization, and Obsidian Graph fidelity:
  - Merging `A + B + C` creates a brand-new Scribble without graph edges (e.g. no `DERIVED_FROM`), storing merge inputs strictly in provenance metadata (`creation_method: "merge"`, `source_scribble_ids`).
  - Source Scribbles move to Trash (recoverable for 30 days).
  - Merged Scribble runs fresh async AI enrichment to synthesize a 3–8 word title, summary, topics, and independent connections to other existing Scribbles, with non-recursive fallback title resolution upon error.
  - Renamed "Suggested Candidates" to "Suggested Scribbles".
  - Maintained AI exploration questions with individual instant-copy buttons.
  - Maintained capture provenance (`VOICE`, `CLIPBOARD`, `FILE`, `TEXT`).
  - Restored Clipboard as an **Active** capture modality (alongside Voice, Text, Files).
  - Enforced tab order: `Capture | Workspace | Knowledge Graph | Split View` with `Workspace` as default.
  - Removed user-facing Tags from the Scribbles UX in favor of Topics and Named Entities.
  - Renamed product terminology everywhere from "Scribble Notes" to "Scribbles".
  - Knowledge Graph: Fixed dynamic zoom-dependent label text fade threshold, collapsed all 4 settings sections (`Filters`, `Groups`, `Display`, `Forces`) by default, added persistent `Save Graph Settings` to `localStorage`, added full-screen mode toggle (with `Escape` key handling), and replaced "Tags" toggle with "Topics".
- **Reason**: Guarantees truthful knowledge architecture without graph pollution, provides genuine Obsidian Graph fidelity, and unifies the entire Scribbles interface.
---

### Decision 43: Phase 11D — Vox Identity, Product Account & Local→Hybrid Foundation (Vox Account != Vox Vault)

- **Context**: Introducing a first-class identity and account foundation using desktop Google Sign-In, stable installation identification, diagnostics, and update services without compromising Vox's zero-cost, local-first privacy promise.
- **Decision made**:
  - **Vox Account $\neq$ Local Vault Invariant**: A Vox account identifies the user and installation; **it does not automatically upload or synchronize the user's knowledge, audio recordings, transcripts, meetings, scribbles, or vault**. The local vault remains 100% functional without an internet connection or authenticated session.
  - **Desktop Google OAuth Flow**: Standard Desktop Authorization Code Flow with PKCE using a local loopback server (`127.0.0.1:{port}/oauth/callback`). Tokens (`access_token`, `refresh_token`) are stored in the OS Keyring / Credential Manager with an encrypted local fallback, completely outside the user's markdown vault and `localStorage`.
  - **Stable Anonymous Installation ID**: Generated once per installation (UUID v4) and persisted in `.Vox/config/installation.json`. Masked in the UI (`••••••••-••••-XXXX`) with click-to-copy for customer support. Not derived from hardware identifiers.
  - **Strict Privacy-First Diagnostics**: Central `DiagnosticsService` strictly firewalls user content. Diagnostic payloads contain only anonymous metadata (`installation_id`, `account_id`, `Vox_version`, `platform`, `event_type`, `timestamp`). Scribble text, voice notes, audio waveforms, transcripts, and graph contents are **never** collected. Controlled by an explicit user toggle in Settings.
  - **Update Service Abstraction**: `UpdateService` handles version checking and compares semver release manifests, degrading gracefully to offline status without blocking or throwing unhandled errors.
  - **Settings → Account Section**: Embedded directly in Settings sidebar with Google profile card, Installation ID, Operating Mode (`Local` with Hybrid preview), Update checker, Diagnostics consent toggle, and Sign Out confirmation modal (explaining local notes remain intact).
  - **First-Run Welcome Experience**: Introduces `WelcomeModal` on fresh install offering "Continue with Google" or "Continue Locally", followed by `AccountExplanationModal` reinforcing local data guarantees upon sign-in.
- **Reason**: Establishes a unified identity layer for upcoming Google Calendar sync, meeting detection, and eventual Hybrid cloud synchronization, while maintaining the strongest part of Vox's value proposition: *Vox can know who you are without needing to know what you know.*
- **Existing Functionality Preserved**: All 91 Rust backend tests pass; frontend builds with zero TypeScript errors.

---

### Decision 44: Phase 11D.1 — Vox Security & Foundation Hardening (RLS Lockdown, Keyring Secrets & Account Deletion)

- **Context**: Hardening the identity, cloud database, and credential architecture following review:
  - Disallowing open RLS policies on Supabase tables in favor of rate-guarded and validated PostgreSQL RPC functions.
  - Relocating all Google Calendar OAuth tokens from the markdown vault directory to the secure OS Keyring.
  - Reinforcing that Desktop OAuth flows operate as public PKCE clients without expecting secret confidentiality.
  - Formally separating **Delete Vox Account** (deletes cloud profile + keyring credentials, disassociates installation) from **Delete Local Vault Data** (destructive vault action).
  - Clarifying the First-Run Onboarding UX to clearly present "Continue with Google" vs "Continue Locally" with no "Skip" terminology.
  - Setting anonymous telemetry to strictly opt-in (`false` by default).
- **Decision made**:
  - **Supabase RPC & RLS Lockdown**: Revoked open write policies; implemented `register_installation_heartbeat` and `ingest_diagnostic_event` RPC endpoints with input validation. Table `SELECT` on `installations` and `diagnostics_events` is strictly locked to `service_role` (or authenticated installation owner).
  - **Zero Secrets in Vault Invariant**: Migrated `GoogleCalendarTokens` out of `vault/google_calendar_token.json` to the OS Keyring / Credential Manager (`keyring` crate) with an encrypted fallback in `.Vox/config/`, permanently purging any legacy token files in the user's markdown vault.
  - **Account Deletion $\ne$ Vault Deletion**: Added `delete_Vox_account` Tauri command and Settings UI modal that deletes cloud profile state while leaving local markdown notes, recordings, scribbles, and meetings 100% untouched.
  - **Opt-In Telemetry by Default**: Changed `default_allow_anonymous_diagnostics` to `false` in `settings/mod.rs`.
- **Reason**: Closes all cloud ingestion security gaps, guarantees zero sensitive tokens in user-accessible markdown directories, and solidifies Vox's local-first privacy guarantees.
- **Verification**: All 93 Rust unit tests pass cleanly; `npm run build` succeeds with zero errors.

---

### Decision 45: Phase 11C.1 — Meetings & Reminders Repair Plan (Broken / Refactor / Improve Triage)

- **Context**: Phase 11C (commits `dfe77dc`, `f6ae3c7`) shipped meeting detection (calendar matching + active-window scanning) and a first meetings surface, and a follow-on commit (`78a6136`, then `3b2684a` — "modernize sidenav… and update meetings experience") replaced it with a Rust reminder scheduler (`meetings/scheduler.rs`), a dedicated popup window (`overlay.rs` + `MeetingReminderWindow.tsx`), and a list-rail/detail-pane split (`MeetingListRail.tsx`/`MeetingDetailPane.tsx`) — none of which was ever logged here, so this entry also backfills that gap rather than implying no decision was made. A line-by-line audit of `3b2684a` against its own stated behavior, cross-checked against how ten comparable open-source meeting-notetaker tools (Meetily, Hyprnote/Anarlog, Meetingnotes, Screenpipe, Scriberr, Whishper, Vibe, plus the whisper.cpp/OpenAI Whisper engines underneath several of them) solve the same detection/notification/recovery problems, found the reminder popup's primary action does not work at all, several structural issues that make similar bugs likely again, and a shorter list of real-but-non-broken UX gaps. This decision records the triage and the repair plan; **the fixes themselves are not yet implemented** — tracked as the next implementation pass against this plan, in the same spirit as `docs/roadmap.md`'s "write down 'not real yet' explicitly" rule.

- **Standing constraints for every fix below** (decided up front, not per-item):
  - **Recording stays on the shared `AudioRecorder` / Dictation Pill — confirmed, not just intended.** `start_meeting_recording` (`commands.rs:1454`) already calls `state.recorder`, the identical `AudioRecorder` instance the Dictation Pill, global hotkey, and click-to-talk use — Decision 19's "no separate recording pipeline" invariant already holds for meetings today. Every fix below corrects *which meeting ID* reaches that existing call, or what happens around it; none may introduce a second capture path for meetings under any circumstance.
  - **UI stays simple.** Wherever a fix could be a minimal control or a configurable subsystem, this decision picks the minimal control — the same restraint Decisions 21 and 29 (PTT-004, PTT-012) already apply to the pill itself.
  - **UX is a standing target, not a closed checklist.** The "Needs Improvement" items below don't exhaust the work; further friction found later gets triaged the same way (Broken / Refactor / Improve) and logged as its own follow-up decision rather than silently folded in as "already handled."

- **Broken — does not work today**:
  1. **Reminder popup's "Start Recording" action fails for all three reminder kinds.** `start_recording_from_reminder` (`scheduler.rs:235-262`) passes a calendar-event ID or a synthetic `detected_<provider>_<title>` string straight to `start_meeting_recording`, which requires an ID that already resolves to a saved vault `Meeting` (`commands.rs:1466-1469`) — none of the three ever does, so it fails with `NOT_FOUND` and the popup only logs the error to console. **Decision**: `start_recording_from_reminder` resolves-or-creates the real vault `Meeting` first, restoring the create-then-record sequence the deleted `MeetingDetectionPopup`/`handleCreateAndStartDetectedMeeting` flow used to guarantee, before calling the existing (correct, unchanged) `start_meeting_recording`.
  2. **A second reminder silently erases the first, permanently.** `ActiveReminderState` holds one payload slot (`scheduler.rs:114,175,200`), and each kind's "notified" flag latches the instant it fires (`scheduler.rs:104-105,165-166,190-191`) — before the user has seen or acted on it. **Decision**: replace the single slot with a small per-meeting-ID queue; a kind is marked "notified" only once the user dismisses or acts on it.
  3. **Dead wiring left from the deleted popup, plus two new no-ops.** `MEETING_DETECTED_EVENT`/`check_meeting_detection` (`commands.rs:1361,1693-1750`) are unregistered and unlistened; the tray's "Start Recording" item emits an event nothing consumes (`lib.rs:114`); `switch-to-meetings-tab` drops its meeting-ID payload (`App.tsx:101-102`). **Decision**: delete the dead event/command pair outright — it has no remaining caller to migrate — and route the tray item and the tab-switch payload through the same single function Refactor #1 introduces, instead of leaving three near-duplicate half-implementations.

- **Needs refactoring — works, but the structure invites the next bug**:
  1. **Two call sites start a meeting recording; only one clears reminder state.** `MeetingPage.tsx:102-106` calls `start_meeting_recording` directly; only the reminder path (`scheduler.rs:219-263`) clears `ActiveReminderState`. **Decision**: consolidate into one frontend function, `startMeetingRecording(meetingId)`, that always calls the shared command *and* clears any reminder/popup state for that ID — used by the list, the popup, and the tray alike.
  2. **The popup's position is computed once and never revisited.** `ensure_reminder_window` (`overlay.rs:177-178`) early-returns on an existing window instead of recomputing, unlike its sibling `ensure_pill_window`. **Decision**: bring `ensure_reminder_window` in line with `ensure_pill_window`'s existing recompute-on-every-show pattern (Decision 31/PTT-014) — adopting an established in-repo pattern, not inventing a new one.
  3. **A global, not per-meeting, recording check suppresses unrelated reminders.** `is_recording_meeting` (`scheduler.rs:83`) silences `unrecorded`/`detected` reminders for every meeting while any one is recording. **Decision**: scope the check to the specific meeting ID being evaluated.
  4. **Settings drift**: Rust `MeetingSettings` has four fields (`settings/mod.rs`); the TS type and the only settings UI (`ProviderSettings.tsx:1310-1336`) expose two, and `auto_record` is persisted but never read anywhere. **Decision**: deferred to a single open product question below rather than guessed at here — either wire `remind_before_meeting`/`auto_record` in and expose both in Settings, or remove them; a setting that silently does nothing either way is the one outcome ruled out.

- **Needs improvement — functions, but the experience is bad**:
  1. **No real snooze.** "Don't remind me" and the ✕ are functionally identical, since each kind only ever fires once. **Decision**: add one "Remind me in 5 min" action alongside dismiss — two choices, not a duration picker, per the simplicity constraint above.
  2. **A missed firing window drops a reminder forever, silently** (asleep, closed, or backgrounded through the `upcoming`/`unrecorded` windows in `scheduler.rs`). **Decision**: on each poll tick, also check for "should have fired but didn't" within a wider grace window and surface it once, clearly marked late — not a full missed-reminders history log.
  3. **Duplicate, uncoordinated notifications** — an OS toast and the custom popup fire together for the same event, and the toast isn't actionable. **Decision**: the popup is the single source of truth; drop the parallel OS toast for reminder events specifically.
  4. **The popup steals focus with no awareness of fullscreen/presentation/screen-share** (`MeetingReminderWindow.tsx:26` calls `.setFocus()` unconditionally). **Decision**: still show the window, but skip `.setFocus()` when the foreground app is fullscreen — borrowing Hyprnote's "don't compete with a user already looking at something" pattern (field research), scoped narrowly to a fullscreen check rather than a full do-not-disturb subsystem.
  5. **Acknowledging a meeting in the main list doesn't dismiss its live popup** — two disconnected notions of "seen." **Decision**: resolved as a side effect of Refactor #1 (shared start-recording function clears reminder state); no separate fix needed.

- **Reason**: The bug list came from tracing each claim directly against `3b2684a`'s source (file:line citations above, not inferred). The specific remediation chosen for each item — rather than a larger rewrite — was checked against ten comparable open-source tools so the fixes converge on patterns already validated elsewhere (Hyprnote's hidden-window/opt-in notification gating; Meetily/Hyprnote's list-then-workspace split, which `MeetingListRail`/`MeetingDetailPane` already matches; Meetily/Vibe's tray-as-real-control; Screenpipe's scrub-by-time fallback for missed capture) instead of one-off guesses.

- **Existing Functionality Preserved**: Calendar matching, active-window detection, the `scheduled → detected → recording → processing → completed/cancelled` meeting lifecycle, the Dictation Pill and every capture guarantee from Decisions 18–31 and 36–38, and the `MeetingListRail`/`MeetingDetailPane` split itself all stay exactly as they are — nothing above requires changing how a meeting is detected or how audio is captured, only how a detected meeting's ID and reminder state are tracked and surfaced.

- **Explicitly Not Changed by this decision**: No source file. This entry is the triage and the repair decision; implementation lands as a separate, subsequent commit against this plan.

- **Deferred / open question carried forward**: whether `auto_record` — a settings field that exists end-to-end except it's never read — should become real auto-record-on-detect, or be removed. That's a product call (does Vox ever start recording a meeting without an explicit user action?), not an engineering one, and is left open rather than decided by default here.

### Decision 46: Native OS Notifications for Meeting Reminders

- **Context**: The dedicated Tauri WebView window (`"meeting-reminder"`, 400x84 size) used for transient meeting reminders caused recurring webview lifecycle bugs (white container artifacts, re-show loops, and hash mismatch issues rendering main `<App />`).
- **Decision made**: Replace the Tauri WebView meeting-reminder window entirely with native OS Toast Notifications (`tauri_plugin_notification`). Reserve Tauri WebView windows strictly for persistent/custom UI surfaces that genuinely require a custom window (`"main"` application window and `"dictation-pill"` overlay).
- **Reason**: Operating system notifications belong in native OS notification centers. Native OS toasts automatically manage visibility, focus, positioning, display scaling, and dismissal lifecycle without webview overhead or container artifacts.
- **Alternatives considered**: Continuing to patch the Tauri WebView `meeting-reminder` window lifecycle.
- **Impact**: Removed `ensure_reminder_window()` and `REMINDER_WINDOW_LABEL` from `overlay.rs`. Deleted `MeetingReminderWindow.tsx`. Removed `meeting-reminder` routing from `main.tsx`. Meeting reminders fire clean native OS Toast notifications while preserving all meeting detection, calendar integration, and queue state machine logic in Rust.

### Decision 47: Talkback — a Conversational Layer over Vox's Existing Knowledge, Not a Second AI Stack

- **Context**: Vox captures (Voice Notes, Meetings), understands (`MeetingFacts`), and remembers (vault, Scribbles, knowledge graph). The missing surface is *conversing* with that. The obvious way to build it — a self-contained voice-agent stack with its own memory store — would have made Vox's fifth silo, and the audit found the ingredients for the alternative already present: a `StreamingTranscriber` (`capture/stt.rs`), a provider-agnostic `LLMClient`, `MeetingFacts` as pre-derived intelligence, and Scribble relationships as a real graph.
- **Decision made**: Build Talkback natively in Rust/Tauri as `talkback/`, sitting **above** the existing knowledge layer. It owns no storage: `talkback::sources` projects Voice Notes, Scribbles, meeting summaries and `MeetingFacts` into one `CandidateDoc` shape, `talkback::retrieval` ranks them, and the tools that persist anything (`talkback::tools`) call `VaultNote::new_voice_note` and `Scribble::new_text` — the same constructors dictation and the Scribble page use. Architecture is `STT → intent → retrieval → streaming LLM → phrase buffer → TTS` (research architecture C), with Pipecat and LiveKit as **reference-only** architectural inputs.
- **Reason**: A realtime speech-to-speech model — the fastest option — has no text turn to attach `source_id`s to, and provenance *is* the product: "what did we decide" is worthless if the user cannot ask where the answer came from. Adopting Pipecat would have put a Python runtime inside a Windows Tauri installer for orchestration Vox can express in ~1,500 lines of its own Rust. Full reasoning and the evidence behind each rejection: `docs/talkback/RESEARCH.md`.
- **Alternatives considered**: Speech-to-speech realtime (rejected — no provenance, no offline, no local option at conversational latency, and every provider is paid SaaS); Pipecat/LiveKit as a dependency (rejected — Python/WebRTC runtime weight; kept as architectural reference); a Talkback-owned memory store (rejected — the exact silo this feature exists to unify).
- **Impact**: New `native/src-tauri/src/talkback/` (11 modules), `tts::TtsProvider` with Piper behind it, `LLMClient::complete_streaming` with a pure per-provider `parse_stream_line`, seven `talkback_*` Tauri commands, `AppSettings.talkback`, and a Talkback navigation surface with an animated agent. 169 new Rust tests, 25 new frontend tests.
- **Existing Functionality Preserved**: The meeting recording clock, 30-second chunking, crash recovery, `MeetingFacts`, Universal Dictation, the Dictation Pill, the production STT path, `capture::VadConfig`, the Scribble schema, and every provider setting — all untouched. Talkback opens its **own** microphone stream (`talkback::audio`) rather than sharing `AudioRecorder` or `DualAudioCapture`, precisely so meeting/dictation timing cannot be affected; `start_talkback` refuses while dictation holds the device, and vice versa.
- **Supersedes**: Decision 15 (In-App Voice Chat) and Decision 16 (Optional Local TTS) are superseded in substance, and Decision 34's deferral of them is resolved by replacement rather than revival — `pipeline::chat::process_chat` is **deleted**, not left beside its successor.

---

### Decision 48: Talkback Retrieval Stays Lexical, and Says So

- **Context**: Decision 6 committed Vox to embedded LanceDB vector search, and `README.md` advertised it. The audit found **no LanceDB dependency in `Cargo.toml` and no embedding code anywhere** — `VaultManager::search_notes` is a term-count scan. Talkback's answer quality depends entirely on retrieval, so this could not be left ambiguous.
- **Decision made**: Ship Talkback with deliberately-designed *lexical* retrieval — IDF-weighted term scoring, title/tag boosts, exact-phrase bonus, per-source weighting, recency decay, one-hop graph expansion, deduplication and a context budget derived from the provider's window — implemented as a pure function (`retrieval::rank`) with `retrieval::score_candidate` documented as the single seam a hybrid lexical+embedding score replaces. Correct the README rather than let it keep claiming a vector store.
- **Reason**: Embeddings need either `fastembed`/`ort` — which carries an unresolved Windows risk (the System32 `onnxruntime.dll` shadows the crate's, and `ort`'s `copy-dylibs` fix targets binary Cargo targets while Vox's crate is `staticlib`/`cdylib`/`rlib`) — or Ollama's `/api/embed`, which needs a model pulled and an index built and invalidated. Neither is a thing to bolt on underneath a feature that has not shipped. Measured, the lexical path costs 2.66 ms per query over 1,000 documents (`docs/talkback/BENCHMARKS.md`), so it is not the bottleneck; retrieval *quality* is the open question, and it is now testable rather than anecdotal.
- **Alternatives considered**: Adding `fastembed` now (rejected — unproven on Windows, and would gate Talkback on a packaging problem); reusing `VaultManager::search_notes` (rejected — term-count over titles and bodies with no source weighting, no provenance, and no budget); claiming LanceDB exists (rejected — the documentation was already wrong, which is how it stayed wrong).
- **Impact**: `README.md` no longer claims a LanceDB vector store. `docs/roadmap.md`'s embedded-vector-RAG item stands, now with a named integration point.
- **Explicitly Not Changed**: `VaultManager::search_notes` and `search_knowledge` keep their current behaviour — they back the existing Scribble search UI, and changing them would change results on a surface Talkback has no business touching.

---

### Decision 49: Talkback Playback Lives in the WebView, and Turn Detection Is Talkback's Own

- **Context**: Two implementation choices with non-obvious reasoning worth recording, because both look like the wrong call from outside.
- **Decision made**: (1) Synthesized audio is returned to the frontend as base64 WAV and played by the Web Audio API, not by Rust. (2) Talkback implements its own streaming turn detector (`talkback::turn`) instead of calling `capture::VadConfig`.
- **Reason**: (1) `rodio` — the obvious Rust playback crate — requires `cpal ^0.17` while Vox pins `cpal 0.15`, so adding it would put two WASAPI stacks in one process; the browser also gives ordered queueing and instant cancellation, which is exactly what barge-in needs. (2) `capture::VadConfig` runs *after* a recording finishes and trims silence off a completed buffer; Talkback needs a decision every 100 ms about whether the user has started and stopped, while audio is still arriving. Modifying the existing VAD to do both would put Talkback's timing requirements inside the dictation and meeting paths.
- **Alternatives considered**: `rodio` (rejected — verified dependency conflict); reusing `meetings_v2::DualAudioCapture` for frames (rejected — it is the meeting recorder, with durable chunking and crash recovery hanging off its clock); extending `capture::VadConfig` (rejected — different timing contract, shared blast radius).
- **Impact**: `tts::TtsAudio` carries base64 WAV; `talkbackAudioQueue.ts` owns ordering and cancellation on the frontend, unit-tested including the "late audio from a turn the user talked over" case. `talkback::turn::TurnDetector::push` is documented as the seam for Silero VAD or Pipecat's Smart Turn v3 once the ONNX-on-Windows question is settled.
- **Known limitation, recorded rather than hidden**: Vox has no acoustic echo cancellation, so on laptop speakers the microphone hears the agent. Mitigated by an echo guard that raises the speech threshold during playback; headphones are the real fix, and the Settings copy says so.

### Decision 50: Talkback Speaks While It Thinks — a Real Producer/Consumer Speech Pipeline

- **Context**: v0.18.0 claimed `STT → intent → retrieval → streaming LLM → sentence buffer → TTS`, and the code did not do it. `generate_streaming` pushed completed phrases into a `Vec` during the stream and synthesized every one of them *after* `complete_streaming` returned. The LLM API streamed, so it looked like streaming TTS from the outside; time-to-first-audio was still the entire generation plus one synthesis. Synthesis also ran inline on the async runtime, parking a Tokio worker on a blocking child process.
- **Decision made**: Add `talkback::speech::SpeechPipeline` — a bounded (24-deep) `sync_channel` feeding a single dedicated synthesis thread. Phrases are pushed from *inside* the LLM stream callback; the worker synthesizes and emits them while the model is still writing. One worker means ordering is structural rather than sorted. The pipeline emits through a `SpeechSink` trait, so ordering, cancellation, "no phrase twice", "no phrase dropped" and the permanent-failure latch are unit-tested against a recording sink with no Tauri app in sight.
- **Reason**: This is the difference between the architecture the research chose and a slower thing that resembles it. Measured on a simulated 5-sentence answer (300 ms/sentence generation, 250 ms synthesis): **600 ms to first audio versus 1,750 ms batched**, and the gap widens with answer length because the batched cost grows with every sentence generated while the overlapped cost is fixed at first-sentence-plus-one-synthesis. A thread rather than a Tokio task because Piper is a blocking child process, and parking a runtime worker on it would stall the very LLM stream feeding the queue.
- **Alternatives considered**: An unbounded queue (rejected — a runaway model would grow a backlog of audio nobody will hear); `spawn_blocking` per phrase (rejected — ordering would then need reassembly, and the single consumer gives it for free); making the stream callback async so it could `await` a Tokio channel (rejected — changes `LLMClient`'s public shape for every caller, to solve a queue that a 400-token output cap means is never full).
- **Impact**: New `native/src-tauri/src/talkback/speech.rs`. `generate_streaming` no longer collects phrases. `TurnMetrics` gains `tts_first_synthesis_ms`, `tts_total_synthesis_ms`, `tts_phrases` and `tts_disabled`, and **`tts_first_audio_ms` is re-anchored to the start of the turn** — it previously measured one synthesis call, which made it look excellent while the user waited seconds. The metric was measuring the wrong thing well.

---

### Decision 51: Local Voice Is a Setup Flow, Not Two Settings Keys

- **Context**: `TtsSettings` was `piper_binary_path` and `piper_voice_path`, and Decision 34 had removed the only UI that ever wrote them. On a fresh install there was **no way to make Talkback speak without hand-editing `.Vox/config/settings.json`** — architecturally complete, and unusable.
- **Decision made**: Add `tts::discovery` and a `Settings › Talkback › Voice` card. Vox owns a managed location (`<app-data>/Vox/tts/piper` and `.../voices`), discovers a binary there without being told, falls back to its own executable directory, then Tauri's resource directory, then `PATH`, and validates both the model and the `.onnx.json` sidecar Piper needs beside it. The UI shows Ready / Not configured, the resolved program and *how it was found*, a voice picker, browse buttons, the exact folders to use, and a **Test voice** button that drives the real provider. The Talkback page carries a "Voice unavailable" banner with the same explanation and a link into settings.
- **Reason**: "I installed Vox. How do I make Talkback speak?" needs a deterministic answer that never involves a text editor. Piper is *not* bundled — the binary plus one voice is 40–100 MB, artifacts are per-platform and per-architecture, and Vox cannot verify a download it never performed — so the honest design is a location Vox owns, discovers, and can name in an instruction. The resource-directory branch means bundling later is a packaging change, not a code change.
- **Alternatives considered**: Bundling Piper (rejected for now — size, per-arch artifacts, and a redistribution story that needs its own decision); downloading it on first run (rejected — Vox would be shipping an unverified binary fetch, and the research constraint is local-first, not auto-installing); assuming `PATH` (rejected — silent failure is exactly the current bug).
- **Impact**: New `tts/discovery.rs`, `TtsStatus`, six commands (`get_tts_status`, `browse_for_piper_binary`, `browse_for_piper_voice`, `set_tts_configuration`, `test_tts_voice`, `prepare_tts_folders`), and `native/src/components/settings/VoiceSettings.tsx`. An explicitly configured path always wins over discovery, and a *stale* configured path is reported rather than silently replaced — silently falling back would hide the user's own broken setting.

---

### Decision 52: The Voice Installation Is Anchored to App-Data, Not to Vox's Config Directory

- **Context**: Vox derives `config_dir` from `std::env::current_dir()/.Vox/config`. That is fine beside a development checkout. In a packaged Windows app it is not: launched from a Start Menu shortcut `current_dir()` is typically `C:\Windows\System32`, and launched from its install directory it is under `Program Files` — neither writable by a standard user, and both liable to change between launches.
- **Decision made**: Resolve the voice installation root from the OS per-user application-data directory (`%APPDATA%` on Windows, `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`/`$HOME/.config` elsewhere), falling back to `config_dir` only when no such location exists. Resolve it **once at startup** into `AppState.tts_root` and pass it explicitly rather than reading environment variables deep in the call graph — which also keeps the discovery tests hermetic instead of mutating process-global state.
- **Reason**: The setup flow's central instruction is "put `piper.exe` in this folder". That instruction is only correct if the folder is stable and writable, and under `current_dir()` it is neither. This is new state with no existing installs, so there is nothing to migrate.
- **Alternatives considered**: Moving *all* of `config_dir` to app-data (rejected — that would relocate every existing user's vault, settings and Whisper models, which is a migration decision with real data-loss risk and no place in a Talkback change); leaving TTS under `config_dir` (rejected — it makes the printed path wrong on the target platform).
- **Explicitly Not Changed**: `config_dir` itself, and therefore the vault, settings file, and Whisper model location. The underlying `current_dir()` weakness remains for those and is recorded in `maybe_later.md` as its own piece of work.
- **Impact**: `AppState.tts_root`, `tts::discovery::default_tts_root`, and every `tts` entry point taking an explicit root. Also fixed alongside: Piper is now spawned with `CREATE_NO_WINDOW` on Windows (without it, one console window flashed per spoken sentence), scratch WAVs are removed by an RAII guard on every exit path including cancellation and panic, and orphaned scratch files are cleared at startup.

---

### Decision 53: Vox Installs the Local Voice Itself

- **Context**: v0.18.1 gave local voice a real configuration UI, and that UI told the user to visit GitHub, find `piper.exe`, put it in an AppData folder, download an `.onnx` model, download its matching `.onnx.json`, put both in a second folder, and press Test. Every one of those steps is an implementation detail of Piper leaking into Vox's product. A user who does not know what ONNX is cannot make Vox speak.
- **Decision made**: One button. `Settings › Talkback → "Make Vox speak" → Download & Set Up → ✓ Ready`. Vox determines the host platform and architecture, downloads the approved engine and a recommended voice from a Vox-owned manifest, verifies both against pinned SHA-256 digests, installs them atomically under its existing app-data root, checks the model and config actually belong together, and **speaks a sentence through the production provider** before reporting Ready. Filesystem paths, engine name and version move behind an `Advanced` disclosure that is not rendered until it is opened.
- **Reason**: "Technically functional" and "usable" are different bars, and the manual flow only cleared the first. The self-test at the end is what makes Ready mean something: files existing is not the same as a voice that loads, and the difference should surface during setup rather than in the middle of the user's first conversation.
- **Alternatives considered**: Bundling Piper and a voice in the installer (rejected — 80–100 MB added to every download for a feature not every user enables, and per-arch artifacts to maintain; the manifest's `bundled` discovery branch means this stays a packaging decision Vox can revisit without code changes); an in-app browser to the download pages (rejected — that is the manual flow with extra steps).
- **Impact**: New `tts/manifest.rs`, `tts/installer.rs`, `resources/voice-manifest.json`, `scripts/build-voice-manifest.mjs`, `install_local_voice`/`cancel_voice_install` commands, a rewritten `VoiceSettings.tsx`. One new dependency, `zip` (pure Rust, no default features) — Piper's Windows release is a zip archive and there is no way to install it without an extractor.
- **Existing Functionality Preserved**: `TtsProvider`, `PiperProvider` and `NullProvider` are unchanged. Download logic is a *separate lifecycle layer*: the provider still only turns text into audio, and the installer only puts files where `discovery` already looks. A manually placed Piper is still discovered, and an explicitly configured path still wins over everything — a developer using their own build is not overridden.

---

### Decision 54: The Manifest Is the Only Source of Download URLs, and an Unverifiable One Is Treated as Absent

- **Context**: An installer needs somewhere to get URLs from. The tempting shape is a constant next to the fetch, or a URL assembled from a voice id. Both mean the code that *asks* for a download can decide what gets downloaded.
- **Decision made**: A single catalogue — `resources/voice-manifest.json`, compiled into the binary with `include_str!` — carries every URL, SHA-256, expected size, archive layout, licence and upstream source. The frontend names a **voice id**; it cannot express a URL. `VoiceManifest::validate()` runs at load and rejects a catalogue with a missing checksum, a non-HTTPS URL, a duplicate id, an unknown engine, or anything other than exactly one recommended voice.
- **Reason**: An interface that can construct download URLs is an interface that can be talked into downloading something else. Compiling the manifest in rather than shipping it as a Tauri resource removes a whole class of packaging failure: a resource can go missing from a bundle, and there is no sensible behaviour when it does.
- **The honest part**: checksums cannot be written by hand. An invented digest fails every install while looking complete; a copied one nobody verified is worse than none. `scripts/build-voice-manifest.mjs` downloads each artifact, hashes it, and rewrites the file — a release step. **Until it has run, the shipped manifest carries empty checksums, `validate()` rejects it, and Vox reports "automatic voice setup isn't available in this build" rather than downloading something it cannot verify.** A catalogue that cannot be trusted is treated as no catalogue at all. This is why the feature is not production ready as committed: the code is complete, the provisioning step is not, and it could not be run from an environment whose egress policy blocks the artifact hosts.
- **Alternatives considered**: Trust-on-first-use (rejected outright — the artifact is an executable); fetching the manifest from a Vox-run server (rejected — adds a server dependency and moves rather than solves the trust problem); shipping placeholder checksums that verification skips (rejected — that is a security hole disguised as a feature flag).
- **Impact**: `Artifact::is_pinned` accepts only 64 hex characters, so an empty string, a `TODO`, or a truncated paste is never mistaken for a digest. Plain HTTP is allowed for loopback only, which is what makes the installer's download, verification and atomicity behaviour testable end-to-end against a local server; a test asserts the shipped catalogue uses HTTPS exclusively.

---

### Decision 55: A Failed Install Must Leave a Working One Untouched

- **Context**: The most damaging outcome of a download feature is not a failed download — it is a failed download that destroys what the user already had. A partially written `piper.exe` over a working one turns a retryable problem into a broken installation.
- **Decision made**: Downloads stream into `<root>/.staging/<uuid>/`, are verified there, and are moved into place with `rename` only after their digest matches. Staging lives under the same root so the rename is atomic within one filesystem. A `StagingDir` guard removes the tree on every exit — success, failure, cancellation, panic — and startup clears staging left by a crash, which cannot run `Drop`. The voice config is moved before the model, so a process killed between the two leaves an inert config rather than a model that looks installed and cannot load. An already-installed engine is reused rather than re-downloaded.
- **Reason**: Retry is the main recovery path for a flaky download, and it is only safe if a failed attempt costs nothing. A test drives this directly: a corrupt voice download against a populated installation must leave both the engine and the previous voice byte-identical.
- **Impact**: Cancellation is checked per 64 KB chunk, so "Cancel" stops within a read rather than at the end of the file. Zip extraction rejects entries whose path escapes the target (zip-slip), and the executable is located by the manifest's declared path with a bounded filename search as a fallback, so an upstream re-layout does not break setup.

---

### Decision 56: The Installer Pins the Last Piper Release That Is Actually a Program

- **Context**: `scripts/build-voice-manifest.mjs` failed on Windows with *"Release v1.7.0 has no asset for piper-windows-x86_64"*, listing six assets that were all Python wheels or an sdist. The obvious reading is a naming drift and the obvious fix is to relax the asset matcher or rename the expected asset. Both would have worked, in the sense that the release step would have gone green.
- **What was actually wrong**: `OHF-Voice/piper1-gpl` does not publish an executable, and never has. Its release workflow uploads `dist/*` — wheels and an sdist — in every release from v1.3.0 to v1.7.0. `piper_tts-1.7.0-cp39-abi3-win_amd64.whl` was downloaded and listed: 432 entries, 39 Python files, an `espeakbridge.pyd`, no `piper.exe`. Its C++ CLI (`libpiper`) is built in CI and never attached to a release. The catalogue had been pointing at a project that could not satisfy the architecture since the day it was written; the manifest was never provisioned, so nobody found out.
- **Decision made**: pin `rhasspy/piper` `2023.11.14-2` — the last upstream release that publishes standalone binaries (`piper_windows_amd64.zip`, `piper_linux_x86_64.tar.gz`, MIT). Add `tar_gz` to `ArchiveKind`, because upstream ships Windows as a zip and every Unix platform as a tarball, and an installer that reads only one of the two supports only one of the platforms. Bump the manifest schema to 2 so a version-1 file — whose Linux entry claims `zip` and points at a tarball — fails loudly rather than half-working.
- **Reason**: Vox downloads an archive and spawns an executable out of it. A wheel needs CPython, `onnxruntime` and a dependency tree resolved on the user's machine; shipping a Python runtime inside a Tauri app to speak a sentence is not a trade Vox is making. Archived upstream is a real cost. It is the honest one: the alternative is not a newer engine, it is no engine.
- **What stops it happening again**: the failure mode is that *a wheel is a zip* — it downloads, hashes and extracts, and every check short of listing its contents passes. So each runtime now names its provenance (`release: { repo, tag, asset }`); the generator resolves that exact asset name rather than matching a pattern; it then **opens the artifact and asserts the declared executable is inside it, non-empty, and runnable**; `manifest.rs` refuses a `.whl` outright and refuses any asset whose extension disagrees with its declared archive kind; and `validate()` re-derives the download URL from the pin, so the artifact, the manifest and the script cannot disagree without the run failing. When a release does turn out to publish only Python distributions, the generator says so in those words, and says not to rename the expected asset.
- **Alternatives considered**: bundling a Python runtime (rejected — a second runtime inside a Tauri app, for one subprocess); building `libpiper` ourselves and hosting it (rejected — Vox would have to become a publisher of native binaries, with the signing and release pipeline that implies); relaxing the matcher to accept the wheel (rejected — it would have installed cleanly and never spoken).
- **Impact**: the security model is unchanged and slightly stronger — HTTPS-only, pinned digest, expected size, safe extraction, atomic install, self-test through the production `PiperProvider`, cancellation and rollback all still hold, and extraction now also caps what an archive may expand to and validates tar symlinks for containment. The user-visible flow is untouched: one button, *Make Vox speak*.

### Decision 57: Capture Is Triggered From Inside the Browser, Because `activeTab` Leaves No Other Least-Privilege Option

- **Context**: The requested shape was an OS-level Vox hotkey (`Ctrl+Space+C`) that captures whatever page the user is looking at. Two things about it turned out not to hold. `Ctrl+Space+C` is not a registrable accelerator — an OS shortcut is modifiers plus one key, and `Space` is not a modifier — and `Ctrl+Space` is already push-to-talk dictation. More importantly, Chrome grants `activeTab` only in response to a gesture made *inside* the browser: executing the extension's action, a context-menu item, a `commands` keyboard shortcut, or an omnibox suggestion. A global desktop hotkey is none of those.
- **Decision made**: The capture trigger lives in the browser — the extension's own command (`Ctrl+Shift+Y`, editable at `chrome://extensions/shortcuts`) or its toolbar button. Vox's `capture_hotkey` (default `Ctrl+Shift+C`) opens the Captures surface and tells the user the browser shortcut; it does not pretend to read the page.
- **Reason**: The only way to make a desktop hotkey read the tab is to give the extension standing access to every site the user visits (`<all_urls>`), which is precisely the access this feature exists to avoid. A capability that requires abandoning least privilege is not the same capability.
- **Alternatives considered**: `<all_urls>` or `optional_host_permissions` plus a desktop→browser request queue (rejected for v1 — it trades the whole permission story for a shortcut, and MV3 service-worker lifetimes make a desktop→browser push unreliable anyway; kept as `maybe_later.md` §13 with its constraints written down); a UI Automation / accessibility read of the browser window (rejected — it returns a flattened, lossy view with no URL guarantee and no conversation structure, which is the screenshot problem with extra steps).
- **Impact**: `hotkeys::try_register_hotkeys` registers a third, independent shortcut. Unlike the other two it never fails `apply_hotkeys`: capture's real trigger is elsewhere, so a conflict on it costs convenience, not the feature.

### Decision 58: A Loopback Bridge, Not Native Messaging — For Now, and With the Exit Named

- **Context**: A browser extension can reach a desktop app two ways: native messaging (stdio to a process the *browser* spawns) or an HTTP request to a loopback port. Native messaging's ceilings are generous (4 GB browser→host, 1 MB back) and it sidesteps sockets entirely.
- **Decision made**: An in-process loopback listener on `127.0.0.1`, authenticated by a 256-bit pairing token in an `X-Vox-Token` header and restricted to browser-extension origins. Off by default.
- **Reason**: Native messaging needs, per browser, a registry key under `HKCU\SOFTWARE\Google\Chrome\NativeMessagingHosts\<name>`, a host manifest, an `allowed_origins` list pinned to a specific extension id, and a **second executable** that then has to reach the already-running Vox process anyway. That is three moving parts and an installer step to replace one listener, in an app that is by definition already running when a capture happens.
- **The honest part**: the loopback bridge's costs are real and named rather than glossed. Any local process can reach the port — which is what the token defends against, and why `/v1/health` requires it too. And Chrome's Local Network Access permission (shipping from Chrome 142) gates public→loopback requests; the WICG explainer defines the address spaces and says **nothing about `chrome-extension://` origins**, so whether extension service workers are in scope is unverified and recorded as such in `docs/capture.md` §3. If they are, native messaging is the migration, and it is confined to `bridge.rs` and `background.ts` — the payload contract, the extractors, normalization and storage are untouched.
- **Impact**: One new module, no new crates: the listener is hand-rolled on `std::net::TcpListener`, the same approach `oauth/flow.rs` already uses for its callback.

---

### Decision 59: A Capture Is a Vault Artifact, Not a New Storage System

- **Context**: Web captures needed somewhere to live. The tempting shapes were a new top-level store, or forcing them into `Scribble` (whose `source_type` constants `browser_page`, `browser_conversation` and `browser_selection` already existed, unused).
- **Decision made**: A capture is a `VaultFile` with an optional `capture: CaptureProvenance` field, stored in its own directory tree (`vault/captures/`) alongside the raw payload it was built from. The `Scribble` browser source types are populated on **promotion**, not on capture.
- **Reason**: Vox already has this shape three times over — a voice note, a meeting and an imported file are all raw artifacts that *promote* into a Scribble, which is what carries them into search and the knowledge graph. A captured page is a fourth raw artifact, not a thought the user wrote. Reusing `VaultFile` means analysis, summarisation, Talkback, promotion, Trash and restore all work with no second code path; `extraction_status`, `content_hash` and `linked_scribble_id` already meant the right things.
- **Why a separate directory rather than mixed into `files/`**: the Files surface lists `vault/files/`, dedupes by content hash across it, and re-extracts text from bytes on disk. All three are wrong for a capture — and keeping captures out of that tree meant the Files surface did not change at all, which is the cheapest possible way to not break it.
- **Impact**: `VaultManager` gained a resolver that finds an artifact id in either tree, so every existing caller — `enrich_vault_file`, `summarize_vault_file`, `create_scribble_from_file` — works on captures without knowing they exist. `reprocess_vault_file` returns early for a capture: its text was normalized from a payload, not extracted from bytes, and re-running document extraction on `capture.json` could only overwrite good content with a failure.

---

### Decision 60: A Capture May Not Claim Completeness It Cannot Evidence

- **Context**: A DOM is not a document. Chat interfaces render only the turns on screen, feeds load as you scroll, and content can exist solely in application state. The failure mode this feature exists to avoid is an artifact that *looks* like the whole page and is not — which is worse than no capture, because the user will trust it later.
- **Decision made**: Coverage is a four-value judgement carried on every capture. `full_document` requires positive evidence — roughly 90%+ of the page's visible text recognised as content, and no virtualization markers on the page. Anything else DOM-derived is `rendered_dom`; dropped content is `partial`; no visible text is `unknown`. Conversations are always `rendered_dom`. Every limitation is written into `capture.notes` as a plain-language sentence and shown verbatim in the UI, with a badge on the list for anything not complete.
- **Reason**: The alternative to admitting a limit is not avoiding it — it is hiding it. And `document.body.innerText` is not a capture: the ratio check exists precisely because a page whose text is 95% navigation should not be recorded as fully captured.
- **What was rejected**: scrolling the user's page to force more content to render (a side effect a capture should not have, and it still would not prove completeness); inferring completeness from message counts (nothing on the page states the true count).
- **Impact**: `derive_fidelity` and `assessCoverage` are pure functions with their own tests, and the coverage a payload claims is *downgraded* in Rust if normalization had to drop anything — the browser's optimism cannot survive the backend's caps.

---

### Decision 61: Home Is a Surface, and the Knowledge Graph Is No Longer a Tab Inside One of Its Inputs

- **Context**: Vox opened on Voice Notes, so the first screen was one capture mode out of six and answered nothing about the rest of the vault. The Knowledge Graph, meanwhile, lived as the third sub-tab of Scribbles (Decision 41) even though it renders topics, entities, sources, meetings and documents — the graph was nested inside one of the things it graphs, and reaching it meant going through a surface it is not about.
- **Decision made**: Two new top-level surfaces. `home` is the landing tab; `graph` is the Knowledge Graph, promoted out of Scribbles, which is left with `Capture | Workspace`. `KnowledgeGraphView` and its `graph/` internals moved from `components/scribble/` to `components/knowledge/`, unchanged apart from their import paths.
- **Reason**: Nesting had a real cost beyond navigation — the Scribbles viewer was fetching `get_knowledge_graph` on every visit to render a list of thoughts, and the graph could only be reached in a state where a scribble was also selected. Splitting them means each surface reads exactly what it draws.
- **What Home is allowed to claim**: every figure on it is derived in `home/homeStats.ts` from the same commands the surfaces themselves call (`get_voice_notes`, `get_scribbles`, `list_meetings_v2`, `get_vault_files`, `get_captures`, `get_knowledge_telemetry`). No `get_home_stats` command was added, deliberately: a count maintained in Rust is a second count that can disagree with the list it summarises. Readiness rows report what is *configured* and say so in those words — the panel does not probe a model, and does not imply it did.
- **Why Home performs no capture of its own**: the six shortcut cards navigate to the surface that owns each mode, passing the requested mode through (`Clipboard` on Home lands on `Scribbles › Capture › Clipboard`). A second `create_scribble` call site on the landing page would be a second implementation of every capture mode to keep true. The voice card names the accelerator read from settings rather than a hardcoded `Ctrl+Space`, and the web-capture card names whether the bridge is actually listening — both were assumptions the Capture Hub had been printing as facts.
- **Impact**: `MainTabType` and the sidebar gained `home` and `graph`; every tab change now goes through one `navigateTo` in `App.tsx` so a one-shot intent (a capture mode, a scribble the graph wants revealed) cannot outlive the navigation that carried it. Double-clicking a scribble node still opens it in Scribbles — now as a cross-surface navigation rather than a sub-tab switch.

---

### Decision 62: Capture Is One Surface, and a Document Belongs to the Files Vault

- **Context**: Decision 61 left the Capture Hub as a sub-tab of Scribbles, so the six capture modes lived inside one of the artifacts they produce — a captured page or an imported document is not a thought, and reaching any of them meant going through the surface for thoughts. Meanwhile `Captures` next door was the browser-capture list only. Two of the hub's six cards were also untrue: `Browser Extension — Future` described a feature that had shipped as `Captures` (Decision 58–60), and `Files & Docs` printed `PDF · DOCX · PNG · JPG · JPEG` above a handler that read the file with `File.text()` and posted the result to `create_file_scribble` — binary bytes stored as a thought's content.
- **Decision made**: The hub moved to `Captures`, which became `Capture | Captured Pages`. `CaptureHubPage.tsx` moved from `components/capture/` (left holding only the dictation pill and its window) to `components/captures/`. Scribbles is left with the workspace alone, plus a `New thought` button that navigates here. `CaptureMethod` narrowed to `text | clipboard` — the two modes the hub performs in place; `Voice`, `Files & Docs`, `Meeting` and `Web Capture` are cards that open the surface that owns them.
- **Why a document goes to Files rather than to a scribble**: there were two file importers, and only one of them worked. `import_vault_file` extracts PDF and Word text, dedupes by content hash, leaves the original untouched and can then be promoted to a Scribble by the path every other raw artifact uses (Decision 59). `create_file_scribble` over `File.text()` could only do plain text, and said otherwise. Deleting the second one is not a lost capability — it is one less way to store a broken document. The Rust command stays registered; nothing in the frontend calls it.
- **Why the two tabs are not two sidebar entries**: they are the same question in two tenses — *what am I capturing* and *what did I capture*. The bridge's progress banner sits above both, so a page arriving from the browser is visible whichever tab is open, and the hub's web-capture card switches tabs rather than navigating away.
- **What was rejected**: making `Captures` a filter over `Files` (Decision 59's reasoning stands — the two lists answer different questions); keeping a `Files & Docs` panel in the hub that called the vault's importer (a second call site for one import is still a second call site).
- **Impact**: `MainTabType` moved out of `App.tsx` into `native/src/types/navigation.ts`, and the sidebar's duplicate `TabType` and Home's hand-listed `HomeSurface` now derive from it. Typing every `onNavigateTab` prop against it removed four `tab as MainTabType` casts — and immediately surfaced `FilesPage`'s `onNavigateTab('scribbles')`, a navigation to a tab that does not exist which had been failing silently. The settings section id `capture` is unchanged so `open_settings_window` and the `Turn it on` button still land there; it is labelled `Web Capture` now, because only the browser bridge is configured there.

### Decision 63: The Meeting Reminder Is an App-Owned Window Again, and Its Key Is Not a Session Id

- **Context**: Meetings V2 could only be recorded by hand — the user had to notice a meeting was starting, open Vox, and press Record. The subsystem that used to do this was removed with the rest of legacy meetings (`docs/meetings/MEETINGS_LEGACY_REMOVAL.md`), and it left two things behind in the tree: a Settings › Developer panel calling `trigger_mock_meeting_reminder` and `debug_detect_conferencing_windows`, neither of which existed any more, and a `notification_surface_mode` developer setting nothing read. This decision restores the feature on V2's own foundations and records why the surface is what it is, since the same question was decided twice before and reversed once (Decision 45, Decision 46).
- **Decision made**: An app-owned Tauri overlay window, `meeting-reminder`, is the reminder. It is created hidden at startup and reused. The native OS toast is kept as a display-only second signal, not the surface.
- **Reason the toast cannot be the surface**: `tauri-plugin-notification`'s **desktop** implementation maps `title`, `body` and `icon` and silently discards `.action_type_id()`; `register_action_types` and action callbacks are mobile-only. A Windows toast can therefore announce a meeting but can never carry Record, Join or Snooze — and a reminder that cannot be acted on is not this feature. Decision 46 chose the toast on the reasonable-sounding grounds that OS notifications belong in OS notification centres, and had to be reversed once that limit was hit. The toast is retained for the one case the overlay genuinely cannot cover: a fullscreen app the always-on-top window is drawn behind.
- **Why a reminder's key is not a meeting id**: a reminder names a calendar event or a conferencing window, both of which exist before any recording does. The removed implementation called this field `meeting_id` and passed it to a command that required an already-persisted meeting, so the popup's primary action returned `NOT_FOUND` for every reminder it ever showed (Decision 45, Broken #1). The field is `key`, prefixed `cal:` or `win:`, and `start_meeting_from_reminder` resolves it to a *title* and starts a new session — it never passes the key on.
- **Why the queue is a queue**: one entry per `(key, kind)`, never a single overwritable slot. The removed `ActiveReminderState` held one payload, so a second reminder erased the first before anybody had seen it (Decision 45, Broken #2). `current()` is derived from the queue rather than stored beside it, which leaves that bug nowhere to reappear.
- **Why detection has a graduation rule**: a window titled `Zoom Meeting` carries no topic and is as likely to be an idle app as a live call, so it must persist across two ticks before it earns an interruption; a window with a real meeting name in its title is evidence enough on the first sighting. The unrecorded reminder is gated the same way in the other direction — it fires only while the call is still on screen, because a meeting the user left is not a meeting they forgot to record.
- **Why the card never takes focus and is `content_protected`**: it arrives exactly when somebody is most likely to be mid-sentence or presenting. Stealing the keyboard to announce a meeting is worse than the meeting going unrecorded, and a card naming a meeting and its participants must not appear in the screen share it interrupts.
- **What Join does**: opens the conferencing link in the default browser and re-arms the reminder one minute later. Joining is not answering the reminder — the meeting still is not being recorded — so Record stays one press away once the user is in the call. Vox opens a call; it never joins one.
- **Alternatives considered**: continuing with toast-only reminders (cannot carry actions, as above); building the card per reminder rather than reusing a hidden window (the creation races and flash-of-white the old surface was known for); polling the calendar on every tick (a network call against somebody's Google account every fifteen seconds, to answer a question whose inputs change hourly — events are cached for two minutes instead, and timing is computed from event start times, so the cache cannot make a reminder late).
- **Reconciled against the toast pipeline that landed alongside it**: a parallel v0.41.0 change (`6baa59b`) implemented the same feature as native Windows toasts carrying `▶ Record`, `◷ Snooze 5m/15m` and `Dismiss`, via `.action_type_id()`, `registerActionTypes` and `onAction`. Checked against `tauri-plugin-notification` 2.3.3, the version this crate pins: `init()` registers only `notify`, `request_permission` and `is_permission_granted`, so `registerActionTypes` has no desktop command to call and rejects; `desktop.rs`'s `show()` maps title, body, icon and sound and drops `action_type_id`; `register_action_types` lives only in `mobile.rs`; `onAction` waits on an `actionPerformed` event desktop never emits. The toast rendered without buttons and nothing routed — the third time this repo has reached that wall, after v0.10.0 and Decision 46. Its `reminders.rs`, `reminder_engine.rs`, `detection.rs` and `App.tsx` wiring are removed in favour of the card. **Its unrecorded gate was better and is kept**: asking whether any recording, running or already finished, covers the meeting's window, rather than only whether something is recording at this instant — so a meeting captured and stopped early is not then reported as unrecorded. That check is now `a_recording_covers`.
- **Existing Functionality Preserved**: the recorder, the two audio clocks, the chunk store, live transcription, processing, and the calendar link on a finished meeting are all untouched. `start_meeting_v2` and `start_meeting_from_reminder` now share one `start_meeting_session`, so the list and the card take exactly the same path and cannot disagree about recording state (Decision 45, Refactor #1).

---

### Decision 64: Retirement and Permanent Removal of the Deferred Next.js Web Application

- **Context**: Decision 32 deferred the `web/` Next.js dashboard and hybrid cloud sync, preserving the directory in place while Vox focused on a desktop-first surface. A repository cleanup audit (2026-09-07) confirmed that `web/` had zero import, build, or runtime dependencies with `native/`. Its presence required separate monorepo build scripts, a duplicate CI job, and obsolete documentation claiming a three-surface architecture that did not exist.
- **Decision made**: Permanently delete the `web/` application directory, its root `package.json` scripts (`dev:web`, `build:web`), its CI job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, and web-exclusive rules (`rules/server-client-boundary.md`, `rules/responsive-design.md`). Vox is explicitly structured as a native-first Windows desktop app (`native/`) with a companion browser extension for web capture (`native/browser-extension/`).
- **Web capture explicitly kept**: Removing the web app does NOT affect browser extension capture (`native/browser-extension/`, `native/src/webcapture/`, `native/src-tauri/src/capture/web/`), which is an active, vital acquisition surface.
- **Supabase native usage explicitly kept**: Removing the web app does NOT remove Supabase. The native Rust backend actively consumes `supabase/migrations/` for anonymous installation tracking, heartbeat, diagnostics, and app release checks (`identity/supabase.rs`, `updates/mod.rs`).
- **Impact**: Cleaned repository layout, unified root scripts to native workflow, dropped unneeded CI runner time, and aligned all documentation with the actual shipping architecture.

---

### Decision 65: A Tier 2 Rewrite May Never Touch a Meeting Transcript

- **Context**: The voice-pipeline unification promoted the deterministic cleanup rules out of `meetings_v2` into `capture::text_normalize`, so dictation and meetings now share one cleanup module. D1 will add a Tier 2 layer above it — an LLM rewrite of dictated text, shipped as a reviewable diff. Sharing Tier 1 makes sharing Tier 2 look like the obvious next step. It is not, and this records why before the code exists rather than after somebody tries it.
- **Decision made**: The Tier 2 rewrite is a dictation-only affordance. A meeting transcript — raw or normalized — is never an input to it.
- **Reason — the raw transcript is already immutable, and this is the same rule**: `transcript.jsonl` is append-only and byte-identical across normalization, summarization, speaker rename and regeneration (`docs/meetings/MEETINGS_INTELLIGENCE_V2.md` §Immutability Guarantee; `Meeting-rules/meeting_speaker_identification.md` §8, "never rewrite the transcript text"). A rewrite layer is the first mechanism Vox would own that is *designed* to change transcript text, so the existing guarantee has to be restated at it explicitly.
- **Reason — dictated text and a transcript are different kinds of object**: dictated text is in flight. It lands in a focused field, the user reads it immediately, and a bad rewrite is one undo away. A meeting transcript is a stored record of what people actually said, read back weeks later by someone who was not there. Rewriting the first is editing a draft; rewriting the second is editing evidence.
- **Reason — the citation chain would break silently**: `sanitize_draft` keeps only claims traceable to a segment id that exists, which is what stops a model citing something it was not shown. A rewrite that merged, split or resegmented would invalidate every citation in `MeetingFacts` without failing anything — the ids would simply stop matching, and the qualification pass would drop real work as unsupported.
- **Reason — the projection precedent already exists**: romanization wanted exactly this power and was built as a projection instead, applied at the command boundary by `capture::romanize::project_json`, leaving the stored transcript untouched. If a rewrite ever has a case for reaching meetings, that is the shape it must take — a view the user can turn off — and it is a separate decision from this one.
- **What `TextProfile` already says, and what this adds**: `TextProfile::Dictated` and `::Transcript` encode that the two surfaces differ in what may be *added* to text (a terminal period is right for a stored segment and wrong for a focused field). This decision states the harder half: what may be *changed*. Tier 1 may normalize a transcript; Tier 2 may not rewrite one.
- **Alternatives considered**: applying the rewrite to the normalized transcript rather than the raw one — still refused, because the normalized transcript is what every citation, the conversation view and the speaker attribution resolve against, so it is the record for every purpose except archival. Making it opt-in per meeting — refused because D1's own premise is that a silent rewrite gives the user no way to notice, and an option that rewrites evidence is still a mechanism for rewriting evidence.
- **Existing Functionality Preserved**: dictation's Tier 1 cleanup, the meeting normalizer, the glossary pass and romanization are all unaffected. This decision constrains a layer that does not exist yet.

---

### Decision 66: The Summarizer Stays Two-Stage — Map-Reduce Over the Transcript Is Refused

- **Context**: Meetily is Vox's closest architectural sibling — the same Tauri/Rust/Ollama shape — and reading it produced several things worth taking, recorded in `Meeting-rules/meeting_notes_competitive_teardown.md` §2.6 and the gap analysis §3.5: dual-capture ducking, audio-file import, and re-transcribe-with-a-different-model. Its map-reduce summarization pattern was evaluated in the same pass and is not one of them. Recorded because the pattern is conventional, it will be proposed again, and the reason to refuse it is specific to Vox's design rather than a general objection.
- **Decision made**: Keep extract → prose. Stage A reduces the transcript to `MeetingFacts`; Stage B writes prose from those facts with the transcript closed. Vox does not summarize by chunking a transcript, summarizing each chunk, and summarizing the summaries.
- **Reason — Stage B not seeing the transcript is the whole design**: a model cannot copy out sentences it was never shown, which is what stops a "summary" becoming a reshuffled transcript (`Meeting-rules/meeting_transcript_summary.md` §1; `meetings_v2::processing::summarize` module doc). Map-reduce puts transcript text in front of the writing model by construction, so adopting it does not adjust that property — it removes it.
- **Reason — Vox already maps over long transcripts, and what crosses the boundary is the point**: `extract_across_windows` runs a pass per window and merges the results. It maps to *facts*, not prose. A fact carries its segment citations, so it can be deduplicated, qualified and renumbered across windows (`merge_facts`, `renumber`, `qualify_action_items`). A prose paragraph carries neither citations nor provenance, so a reduce step over prose can only concatenate or re-summarize, and both lose attribution irrecoverably.
- **Reason — one canonical intermediate is what keeps the projections consistent**: summary, action items, topics, entities and the Scribble are all projections of the same `MeetingFacts`, which is why no two of them can disagree about what the meeting decided. Map-reduce produces prose with no canonical intermediate, so each projection would have to be derived independently — and they would drift.
- **Reason — action items are qualified once, in one place**: every candidate, from the model and from the deterministic extractor alike, goes through `qualify_action_items` against the real segments, which is where the cap is enforced in code rather than in a prompt. A map-reduce summarizer has no equivalent choke point; the qualification would have to move into the prompt, which is exactly where it used to fail.
- **Reason — the deterministic floor depends on the facts existing**: when no model is reachable, the same `MeetingFacts` are rendered deterministically, so a meeting is never left with nothing to show. With no facts stage there is nothing to render from, and an unreachable model means no summary at all.
- **Alternatives considered**: map-reduce only for transcripts that exceed the prompt budget — refused, because it would mean long meetings silently get a structurally weaker summary than short ones, and the long ones are where attribution matters most. Windowed extraction already handles that case and keeps the citations.
- **Existing Functionality Preserved**: everything. This decision is a refusal, and the pipeline it protects is the one that ships.

### Decision 67: Meetings Return, Modelled on Meetily, and Decision 66 Is Superseded

- **Context**: `meetings_v2` was removed wholesale in 2137fbd — 44k lines across capture, diarization, a two-stage extraction pipeline, calendar matching and reminders — to narrow Vox to capture and synthesis. This decision brings meeting recording back, deliberately smaller, built on Meetily's architecture rather than on a reconstruction of what was deleted. The request was explicit: replicate Meetily inside Vox.
- **Decision made**: A new `native/src-tauri/src/meetings/` subsystem: dual-stream capture, a streaming VAD segmenter, one serial decoder, durable checkpoints, a file-backed store, and JSON-templated summarization. `docs/meetings.md` is its living spec.
- **Decision 66 is superseded, not overturned on its merits.** Decision 66 refused map-reduce summarization because Vox summarized in two stages — Stage A reduced the transcript to `MeetingFacts` with per-segment citations, Stage B wrote prose with the transcript closed — and map-reduce would have put transcript text in front of the writing model, destroyed the citation chain, and removed the canonical intermediate every projection was derived from. Every one of those reasons was about `meetings_v2::processing`, and `meetings_v2::processing` no longer exists. There is no `MeetingFacts`, no `extract_across_windows`, no `qualify_action_items`, and no deterministic renderer to fall back on. Decision 66 now protects a pipeline that was deleted three commits before this one.
- **What is given up, stated plainly**: the new summarizer shows the transcript to the model that writes the report — in one pass when it fits the context window, in chunk-then-assemble passes when it does not. So Decision 66's central property, that a model cannot copy out sentences it was never shown, is gone. Reports can therefore read more like paraphrase than synthesis, and there are no per-claim segment citations to qualify against. That is a real regression against what `meetings_v2` did, and it is the price of the smaller subsystem.
- **What is kept from Decision 66's reasoning**: the concern was never the chunking, it was the loss of a canonical intermediate. If meeting reports are worth deepening later, the shape to restore is extract-then-write — a facts intermediate with citations, chunked the way `extract_across_windows` chunked it — not a longer prompt. `summary/processor.rs` is where that would go, and it is structured as pure prompt-building functions so that change is additive.
- **What replaces the deterministic floor**: nothing renders a report when no model is reachable. Instead the failure is honest — `complete_verified` refuses the provider layer's canned heuristic filler, so a meeting with no reachable model has no report rather than an invented one, and the transcript is still complete and searchable on its own.
- **Alternatives considered**: rebuilding `meetings_v2`'s extraction pipeline first — refused, because the request was for Meetily's architecture and because a facts pipeline with no recording subsystem under it has nothing to extract from. Shipping summarization only for transcripts that fit one context window — refused, because long meetings are exactly the ones worth summarizing.
- **Existing Functionality Preserved**: dictation, scribbles, web capture, the vault and the knowledge graph are untouched. Meetings add a surface; they change nothing that existed. Decision 65 (a Tier 2 rewrite may never touch a meeting transcript) survives intact and now has a transcript to apply to again.

---

### Decision 68: Meetings Label the Capture Channel, Not the Speaker

- **Context**: `meetings_v2` shipped acoustic diarization — MFCC statistics and a pitch estimate, clustered per meeting, with `DiarizationReport::well_separated` reporting when the roster should not be trusted. It was removed with the rest of the subsystem. Meetily has no diarization at all: it sums the microphone and the system loopback into one mono buffer before its VAD runs (`audio/pipeline.rs:154`), which is why the `speaker` column its migrations create is never written by any query. Rebuilding meetings raised the question again.
- **Decision made**: Transcript lines carry the **capture channel** — `You`, `Others`, or `Speaker` when neither dominates — and nothing claims to be speaker identity. The mixer keeps each channel's energy alongside the mixed window; a span is attributed to a channel only when that channel's RMS is three times the other's.
- **Reason — it is free and it is true**: the microphone and the loopback are two streams. Which one carried a span is a measurement, not an inference, and it answers the question people actually ask of a meeting transcript. Meetily destroys this information by construction and gets nothing in return.
- **Reason — it is honest about its ceiling**: two people on the far end of a call are both `Others` and cannot be separated. That limit is stated in the UI, in `docs/meetings.md`, and in the summarization prompt, which tells the model never to invent individual names for the far end.
- **Reason — the conservative threshold is the point**: a wrong `You`/`Others` label on a line is worse than no label, because a reader cannot tell it is wrong. Three-to-one dominance means overlapping speech reads as `Speaker` rather than as a guess.
- **What this is not**: it is not a step towards a voiceprint library. `maybe_later.md` item 11 remains deferred and remains the feature that would create biometric data.
- **Alternatives considered**: restoring `meetings_v2::diarize` — refused for now as a separate piece of work with its own accuracy question, not a prerequisite for recording meetings at all. Labelling every line `Speaker` — refused, because it throws away a real measurement to avoid claiming a different one.
- **Existing Functionality Preserved**: everything. This decision describes a field that did not exist before.
