# Vox — Testing Strategy

What is actually tested today, and how to run it. `rules/testing.md` holds the
conventions (frameworks, placement, what not to test); this file holds the
state of play. CI runs all of it on every push and pull request —
`.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

## 1. Rust backend (`native/src-tauri/`)

1117 tests (+4 ignored benchmarks), `cargo test`.

```bash
cd native/src-tauri
cargo test
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
```

Building needs a C/C++ toolchain and CMake for whisper.cpp. On Linux it also
needs the GTK/WebKit and ALSA development headers — the CI workflow's `system
dependencies` step is the authoritative package list.

The compiler version is pinned in `native/src-tauri/rust-toolchain.toml` and
installed by rustup on the first `cargo` call. That pin is what makes a local
`clippy -D warnings` mean the same thing as CI's: lints are added between Rust
releases, so a floating `stable` turns "passes locally" into a coin flip.

Where the coverage sits:

- `meetings_v2/processing/` — the largest concentration by far: normalization,
  speaker attribution, extraction, qualification, validation, summarization,
  and the context windower.
- `meetings_v2/processing/eval.rs` — a deterministic, model-free scorer over a
  fixture set, with hallucination as a hard fail. This is the quality gate for
  summary output; it does not call a model and does not need one.
- `meetings_v2/transcript_health.rs` — the screen that decides whether decoded
  text is speech. Fixtures include the reported failure verbatim (seventy-three
  repetitions of "Thank you.") and thirty seconds of synthesized room tone
  whose mean RMS deliberately clears the fixed threshold this replaced, so the
  gate test proves something rather than passing on a quiet fixture. Both
  directions of the filler rule are covered: the same phrase is rejected over
  silence and kept over speech.
- `meetings_v2/diarize/` — `fixtures.rs` synthesizes voices that behave like
  real ones (conversational pitch spread, overlapping formants, one shared
  recording chain) and is the ground truth every engine is calibrated against;
  it exists because the fixtures it replaces were an octave apart, which is why
  a three-person meeting shipped reporting one speaker. On top of it: three
  voices separating, one wandering voice staying one, two similar voices
  merging rather than risking an invented speaker, the expected count
  recovering a forced split, and the ceiling capping rather than collapsing.
  `incremental.rs` covers a registry finding voices as they arrive and
  identifying the local user by comparison; `engine.rs` runs all three methods
  over one on-disk recording. `diarize/mod.rs` drives the whole path against
  real WAVs in a temporary vault, including an assertion that it never writes
  to `transcript.jsonl`.
- `meetings_v2/selftest.rs` — asserts every check the Diagnostics panel offers
  passes on a correct build, and that each one reports a measurement rather
  than a bare verdict. A red panel a user cannot interpret is worse than none.
- `meetings_v2/processing/{metadata,names,directives,share}.rs` — the counted
  header, name inference from self-introductions and direct address, applying
  typed notes to the speaker registry, and composing a shareable document
  including its own disclosures.
- `meetings_v2/processing/validate.rs` — among the rest, that a summary
  omitting a section the facts have content for is rejected, that headings are
  matched on their words rather than byte-identically, and that a meeting which
  settled nothing is not failed for having no Decisions section.
- `settings/` — schema defaults, serde aliases, and backward compatibility with
  settings files written by earlier versions.
- `vault/` — frontmatter parsing, note and scribble CRUD, merge behaviour.
- `capture/evaluation.rs` — the STT benchmark matrix and VAD behaviour.
- `capture/web/` — the web capture path, and the second-largest concentration
  after meetings: URL-based source detection, sanitization (control and
  bidirectional characters, non-`http(s)` link targets, `mermaid` fence
  downgrade, fence escaping), coverage downgrade when caps are hit, refusal of
  an empty capture, the loopback bridge's token comparison / origin refusal /
  size limits over a real socket, and an end-to-end set that drives a payload
  into the vault and checks re-capture versioning, Files isolation, promotion
  provenance, a Trash round-trip and path-traversal refusal.
- `sync.rs` — mutex poison recovery, including a test that pins the failure
  mode it exists to prevent.

Providers are exercised through a fake LLM (`processing/llm.rs`'s test module),
never a live Ollama instance or a cloud API.

## 2. Native frontend (`native/src/`)

461 tests, Vitest + React Testing Library, jsdom.

```bash
cd native
npm ci
npm test              # vitest run
npm run test:watch
npm run test:coverage
npm run typecheck     # tsc --noEmit
```

Tauri modules (`@tauri-apps/api/core`, `/event`, `/window`) are stubbed
globally in `src/test/setup.ts`, because they only resolve inside a Tauri
webview. A test overrides one with
`vi.mocked(invoke).mockImplementation(...)`. `src/test/factories.ts` builds
complete, typed domain objects so a test states only what it is about.

Where the coverage sits:

- `meetings_v2/meetingProcessing.ts` — speaker and owner label resolution,
  title preference, timestamp formatting, processing status.
- `meetings_v2/meetingsViewState.ts` — active-state classification, word
  counting across the durable and live streams, selected-session resolution.
- `meetings_v2/MeetingsV2View.tsx` — behaviour tests driven entirely through
  `invoke` responses: what the list shows, adopting a recording already in
  progress, and surviving a failed load.
- `meetings_v2/MeetingMetadataHeader.tsx` — that the header names participants
  rather than only counting chunks, distinguishes a confirmed name from an
  inferred one, marks somebody who was mentioned but never heard, and says how
  much of a recording was discarded (and that the audio is intact).
- `meetings_v2/MeetingNotesTab.tsx` — that the structured kinds come before the
  paragraph box, that a name correction reaches the backend as a typed
  directive against a real speaker, that one which names nobody cannot be
  submitted, and that a rejected directive is shown rather than swallowed.
- `meetings_v2/MeetingConversationTab.tsx` — that a channel-only roster says so
  and offers to separate the voices, that a marginal split is reported as
  marginal, that unattributed stretches are reported rather than guessed, and
  that renaming a speaker leaves the turn text alone.
- `meetings_v2/MeetingRawTranscriptTab.tsx` — that a rejected chunk renders as
  rejected with its reason and voiced-time measurement, that the discarded text
  stays available as the evidence, and that a silent chunk is distinguishable
  from a discarded one.
- `diagnostics/MeetingPipelineDiagnostics.tsx` — that nothing runs until asked,
  that each verdict arrives with the measurement behind it, and that what the
  installed Whisper model invented on room tone is shown.
- `diagnostics/SpeakerEngineComparison.tsx` — that all three separation methods
  are run over one existing recording, that the one in use is marked, that a
  method which could not run is reported rather than dropped, and that a
  confident roster reads differently from one worth checking.
- `knowledge/graph/graphPhysics.ts` — layout invariants: pinned nodes never
  drift, alpha always decays to zero, coincident nodes separate rather than
  producing `NaN`.
- `knowledge/KnowledgeGraphPage.tsx` — that the surface reads the graph itself
  rather than depending on Scribbles, that it summarises what the canvas
  toolbar does not, and that an empty or unreadable graph says so instead of
  drawing a blank canvas.
- `home/homeStats.ts` — every figure Home shows: week deltas that refuse to
  count an unparseable date, transcribed-word and recording-time sums, the
  promotion and enrichment backlogs, case-insensitive topic distinctness, the
  cross-surface activity merge (an unreadable timestamp sorts last rather than
  vanishing), and each formatter's degenerate input.
- `home/HomePage.tsx` — the wiring rather than the layout: that a capture card
  opens the mode it names instead of capturing on the landing page, that a
  counter navigates to its own surface, that the dictation hotkey shown is the
  configured one, that an unconfigured capability offers the control that fixes
  it, and that one failing vault read degrades that surface without hiding the
  others.
- `lib/soundEffects.ts` — the only code path behind the `dictation_sounds`
  setting, over a stubbed Web Audio API.
- `webcapture/` — the browser extension's extraction layer, tested against
  fixture documents in jsdom: block extraction (headings, lists, code, tables,
  quotes, images), hidden content, malformed markup, deep nesting, duplicate
  text, unicode, link resolution, `<head>` metadata, every coverage verdict,
  and each site extractor's role attribution, turn ordering, fallback
  strategies and refusal to guess.
- `components/captures/` — completeness wording (a capture may only claim the
  whole page when coverage says so), filtering, the bridge-off warning, and
  deletion behind a confirmation.

### The cross-language contract

`webcapture/contract.test.ts` generates the payload fixtures under
`native/src-tauri/src/capture/web/fixtures/` from committed HTML, and
`capture::web::contract_tests` consumes the same bytes. A field renamed on
either side of the extension↔backend boundary fails one of the two suites
immediately rather than failing quietly on a user's next capture. Regenerate
with:

```bash
cd native && Vox_UPDATE_CAPTURE_FIXTURES=1 npm test
```



## Known gaps

- `cargo fmt --check` is not a CI gate. The crate predates any formatting pass
  and currently differs from rustfmt in 45 files; running `cargo fmt` once, as
  its own commit, is what unblocks adding it.
- Several large native components have no tests: `ProviderSettings.tsx` (1,874
  lines), `ScribbleDetailEditor.tsx`, `DictationPill.tsx`. The pill is the
  highest-value of these, since it owns the capture state machine.
- No end-to-end test drives a real recording through capture, STT, and
  processing. The eval fixtures cover the processing half of that.
- **No browser-level test drives web capture in a real browser.** The
  extraction layer is covered by jsdom fixtures and the wire format by the
  contract tests above, but a fixture cannot tell you that ChatGPT changed its
  markup last week. `docs/capture.md` §11 holds the reproducible manual
  procedure, and it is the only thing that validates the site extractors
  against live pages.
- The extension bundle build (`npm run build:extension`) is not a CI step. Its
  sources live under `native/src/webcapture/`, so they are typechecked and
  unit-tested with the rest of the frontend; what is unverified in CI is the
  bundling itself.
