# Vox documentation

The map of what's written down, where, and — importantly — what each file is
allowed to claim. Documentation that outlives its subject is worse than none,
because the next reader (human or agent) treats it as current.

## Living specification

These describe Vox as it is now. If one disagrees with the code, the code
is right and the document is a bug to be fixed in the same change.

| File | Scope |
|---|---|
| [product.md](product.md) | What Vox is, who it's for, and the differentiators. |
| [requirements.md](requirements.md) | Numbered functional and non-functional requirements. |
| [architecture.md](architecture.md) | The surfaces and how they relate. |
| [data-model.md](data-model.md) | Vault file layouts, frontmatter schemas, settings shape. |
| [api.md](api.md) | Tauri command conventions and the `CommandError` contract. |
| [user-flows.md](user-flows.md) | End-to-end flows through the shipped features. |
| [meetings.md](meetings.md) | Meetings: dual-stream capture, streaming segmentation, the serial decoder, durable checkpoints, templated reports, and every place this deliberately differs from Meetily. |
| [capture.md](capture.md) | Web capture: the browser extension, the loopback bridge, the reveal-and-extract architecture, what a capture may claim about its own completeness, and why captured content is never an instruction. |
| [testing.md](testing.md) | What is tested, with what, and where the tests live. |
| [speech-providers.md](speech-providers.md) | The speech engines behind `SpeechRecognizer`: what each can do, what it cannot, what is unmeasured, and how a task picks one. |
| [GOOGLE_OAUTH_SETUP.md](GOOGLE_OAUTH_SETUP.md) | The OAuth 2.0 PKCE architecture and Google Cloud setup. |

## Decision records

Append-only. Entries are never edited to match later reality — a decision
that was reversed gets a new entry saying so.

| File | Scope |
|---|---|
| [decisions.md](decisions.md) | The master decision log, numbered. |
| [decisions-push-to-talk-pill.md](decisions-push-to-talk-pill.md) | The pill redesign's own numbered decisions (PTT-00N). |
| [speech-decision-log.md](speech-decision-log.md) | The speech stack's own numbered decisions (D-0NN) — capture, segmentation, STT, transcript, speakers, TTS. |

## Honest gaps

| File | Scope |
|---|---|
| [roadmap.md](roadmap.md) | What is real vs. stubbed, and what's next. |
| [../maybe_later.md](../maybe_later.md) | Deferred features, per `rules/maybe-later.md`. |
| [spikes/onnx-windows.md](spikes/onnx-windows.md) | Whether `ort` builds, bundles and runs in a real Windows Tauri binary — written, never run, and blocking two approved features until someone runs it. |

## Deep records

Long-form analyses written against a specific version. Each one states the
version it was traced from; read them as history, not as instructions.

| File | Scope |
|---|---|
| [capture/RESEARCH.md](capture/RESEARCH.md) | The research pass behind Capture v2's progressive traversal: how browsers hide content, what was verified in a real browser and what was not, the traversal and expansion designs, and the architectures rejected. |
| [capture/BENCHMARKS.md](capture/BENCHMARKS.md) | What the reveal pass costs, measured — and, explicitly, what has not been measured. |
| [speech-architecture-audit.md](speech-architecture-audit.md) | The speech stack traced end to end at v0.1.0: the real data flow from microphone sample to report, where audio can be lost, where latency and accuracy actually go, what must not be rewritten, and what has to be measured before it is. |

## Archive

Context preserved for removed features. Not specifications — nothing here
describes code that exists.

| File | Scope |
|---|---|
| [archive/prompt-mode.md](archive/prompt-mode.md) | Prompt Mode, removed in v0.15.0, and the thinking behind it. |

## Elsewhere in the repo

| Path | Scope |
|---|---|
| `../AGENTS.md` | Entry point for agents: surfaces, rule index, verification commands. |
| `../rules/` | Coding conventions, enforced per surface. |
| `../CHANGELOG.md` | Per-version record of what shipped. |

## Adding a document

Before creating a new file, check whether the content belongs in one that
already exists. In order of preference:

1. A code comment, next to what it describes.
2. An entry in `decisions.md` (a choice) or `maybe_later.md` (a deferral).
3. An edit to one of the living-specification files above.
4. A new file — and then add it to this index in the same commit.

A per-task working document ("implementation plan", "update report", "audit
of what I'm about to do") does not belong in the repository at all. Its
durable content is a decision entry and a changelog line; the rest is
scaffolding that goes stale the moment the task ships.
