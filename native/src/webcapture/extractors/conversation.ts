/**
 * Shared machinery for conversation extractors.
 *
 * Every chat interface Relay knows about has the same shape underneath —
 * turns, in order, each attributable to a role, each possibly carrying files
 * and images — and the same hazard: the DOM holds only the turns the app has
 * chosen to render. That hazard is handled once, here, so a site extractor is
 * a list of selectors, a role rule, and the two or three site-specific things
 * a generic block walk cannot recognise.
 *
 * The important structural point is `harvest`: it answers "what is mounted
 * right now", the reveal engine calls it after every settle, and `extract` is
 * that same harvest assembled into a result. One set of selectors, used by
 * both paths, so a site redesign breaks one thing rather than two.
