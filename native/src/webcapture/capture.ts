/**
 * The capture orchestrator: document in, payload out.
 *
 * Two things live here, and only here.
 *
 * **The acquisition order.** Inspect, reveal only what needs revealing,
 * extract, deduplicate, reconstruct, then judge completeness. The least
 * invasive mechanism that can obtain the content is the one used: content
 * already in the DOM is read, content that is merely clipped is read, and only
 * content that is genuinely absent earns an interaction.
 *
 * **The fallback ladder**, which is the whole reliability story of the feature:
 *
 * 1. a site-specific extractor recognised the page → structured
 * 2. the generic article extractor found a main region → generic
 * 3. the page's visible text → text-only
 * 4. nothing readable at all → refuse, and say so
 *
 * A step never silently substitutes for the one above it: whichever rung was
 * reached is recorded in the payload, so the artifact can tell the user how it
 * was made — and, since v2, how completely.
