/**
 * The injected content script.
 *
 * Injected on demand under `activeTab` — never declared in the manifest, so
 * the extension has no standing access to any page. It runs in the isolated
 * world (the default), which means it can read the rendered DOM but cannot
 * see or be seen by the page's own JavaScript. Nothing captured is ever
 * evaluated, in either direction.
 *
 * It reads the document, reveals what the browser will legitimately reveal,
 * builds a payload and hands it back to the service worker. It never talks to
 * the network, and the only writes it makes to the page are the two the reveal
 * engine is allowed: moving the scroll position (restored afterwards) and
 * activating controls whose sole purpose is to disclose content.

 * under the same `activeTab` grant. Chrome awaits a promise returned from an
