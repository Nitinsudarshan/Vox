//! Tier 2 — the rewrite that may change words, and the diff that makes it
//! reviewable.
//!
//! `text_normalize` is Tier 1: deterministic, meaning-preserving, always on.
//! Its own docs say the rules that "change meaning belong to the opt-in rewrite
//! layer, not to this one". This is that layer.
//!
//! # Why a diff, and not just a better prompt
//!
//! The objection to letting a model rewrite what somebody said is not that it
//! might be wrong. Every part of this pipeline might be wrong. The objection is
//! that a *silent* rewrite gives the user no way to notice — they see fluent
//! text, it reads like what they meant, and the one word that changed the
//! meaning is invisible precisely because the result is fluent. Hedging with a
//! conservative prompt does not answer that; it only makes the failure rarer
//! and no more visible.
//!
//! A diff answers it. [`diff_words`] is deterministic, runs on every rewrite,
//! and is the reason this layer can be trusted at all: whatever the model did
//! is shown as what it did.
//!
//! # Dictation only
//!
//! Decision 65. A meeting transcript is a record of what people said, read back
//! weeks later and cited by segment id; dictated text is a draft in flight that
//! the user is watching land. This module is reachable only from the dictation
//! path, and nothing here takes a transcript.
