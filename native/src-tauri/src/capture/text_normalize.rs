//! The deterministic text-cleanup rules, shared by every surface that turns
//! speech into text.
//!
//! These were written for meeting transcripts and were reachable only from the
//! meeting pipeline, so dictation and Talkback shipped raw Whisper output while
//! meetings got glossary repair, repetition collapsing and sentence casing.
//! Nothing here is meeting-specific: a decoder stutter is a decoder stutter
//! wherever it is decoded, and a mistranscribed project name is worth fixing in
//! a dictated sentence too.
//!
//! Every rule is deterministic and reports itself. No model runs here, so
//! nothing in this module can invent a word that was not spoken — which is what
//! makes it safe to apply everywhere and without asking. The rules that *can*
//! change meaning belong to the opt-in rewrite layer, not to this one.
//!
//! Each function names the rule it applied, so a misbehaving rule is visible in
//! the artifact rather than only in the output.

/// Rule names, recorded per segment and counted per transcript so a misbehaving
/// rule is visible without re-running anything.
