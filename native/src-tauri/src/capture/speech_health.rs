//! Tells speech apart from what Whisper produces when there is no speech.
//!
//! Whisper is a sequence model with no way to say "nothing was said". Handed
//! thirty seconds of room tone, a fan, or a muted call, it emits the highest
//! probability continuation it knows — which, for a model trained on captioned
//! video, is subtitle boilerplate: "Thank you.", "Thanks for watching.",
//! "Subtitles by the Amara.org community". Once it starts, the decoder's own
//! output conditions the rest of the window, so a single such token becomes a
//! loop that fills the whole chunk.
//!
//! Two defences live here, and they are deliberately separate:
//!
//! 1. **Before the decode** — [`profile_speech`] measures how much of a chunk
//!    is actually voiced, at 20 ms resolution and against the chunk's *own*
//!    noise floor. A chunk-wide RMS mean cannot do this: constant hiss at
//!    0.006 RMS clears any fixed threshold for the full thirty seconds while
//!    containing no speech at all, which is exactly how a meeting ends up with
//!    240 seconds of "Thank you."
//!
//! 2. **After the decode** — [`assess`] rejects text that no plausible speech
//!    could have produced: an adjacent phrase loop, subtitle filler over audio
//!    with no voice in it, Whisper's own no-speech probability, or more words
//!    than the voiced time could physically hold.
//!
//! Nothing here rewrites a transcript. A rejection replaces the text with
//! nothing and records what was discarded and why, so the failure is visible
//! in the artifact rather than mistaken for something a person said.
