//! Web capture — turning the page a user is looking at into a durable Relay
//! artifact.
//!
//! ## Where the work happens
//!
//! Extraction happens in the browser, because that is the only place the
//! rendered DOM exists. A browser extension reads the active tab (under
//! `activeTab`, which browsers grant only on an explicit in-browser gesture)
//! and posts a **structured, text-only** payload to Relay's loopback bridge
//! (`bridge.rs`).
//!
//! Relay then does everything that must not be delegated to a webpage:
//!
//! 1. **Validate** the payload — size, protocol version, URL scheme.
//! 2. **Detect the source** from the URL (`source.rs`), never from what the
//!    page claimed to be.
//! 3. **Sanitize and normalize** into markdown (`normalize.rs`).
//! 4. **Persist** as a Vault artifact, before any AI runs.
//!
//! Analysis is a separate, later, failable step. A capture that never gets
//! analysed is still a complete capture.
//!
//! ## Trust model
//!
//! Every string in a payload is attacker-controlled: a webpage can put
//! anything in its own DOM. Nothing here is executed, nothing is stored as
//! HTML, and every URL that survives into the artifact is scheme-checked.
