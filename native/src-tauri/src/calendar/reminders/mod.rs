//! Telling somebody a meeting is about to happen, and letting them act on it.
//!
//! Three questions decide whether a reminder exists at all, and they are asked
//! of two independent sources. The calendar knows what was scheduled and who
//! was invited; `detection` knows which conferencing app is actually on screen.
//! Neither alone is enough — a calendar entry for a call the user quietly left
//! is not a meeting, and a stray idle Zoom window is not one either.
//!
//! Three properties this module holds:
//!
//! * **A queue, never a slot.** Every tracked reminder is one entry keyed by
//!   `(key, kind)`. The subsystem this replaces held a single overwritable
//!   payload, so a second reminder silently erased the first one before anybody
//!   had seen it (`docs/decisions.md` Decision 45, Broken #2).
//! * **Fired once, per transition.** `recompute` returns what *became* due on
//!   this call, not everything currently due, so the caller raises one
//!   notification per reminder rather than one per poll tick.
//! * **A key is not a session id.** A reminder names a calendar event or a
//!   window, both of which exist before any recording does. Handing such a
//!   string to a command that wants a real session id is what made the old
//!   popup's primary action fail for every reminder it ever showed (Decision
//!   45, Broken #1); the type keeps them apart.
