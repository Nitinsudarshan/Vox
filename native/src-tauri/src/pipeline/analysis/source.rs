//! What a source *is*, for the purpose of analysing it.
//!
//! # Why this is a view and not a record
//!
//! Relay already persists sources. A [`VaultFile`] is the artifact for an
//! imported document and for a web capture alike, `CaptureProvenance` records
//! where a captured one came from, and the meetings pipeline keeps its own
//! session records. Adding a fourth persisted source model would create a
//! second source of truth about the same files, and the migration would be the
//! whole task.
//!
//! So [`SourceDescriptor`] borrows. It is built from an artifact at analysis
//! time, answers the one question the analysis layer needs — *what am I
//! looking at, and how much of it does Relay actually have?* — and is dropped
//! afterwards. Nothing is written, nothing can drift, and a source that
//! predates this module describes itself correctly the first time it is read.
//!
//! # Identity
//!
//! A source's id is the artifact's id. That is what makes re-analysis produce
//! a new derived artifact rather than a new source, and it is why recapture
//! semantics (`version`, `previous_capture_id`) are untouched here: they
//! belong to the source, and analysis has no business changing them.
