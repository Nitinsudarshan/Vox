//! The one place an analysis is executed.
//!
//! Everything that is the same for every analysis lives here: resolving the
//! prompt, applying the source boundary, choosing sampling, calling the
//! provider, parsing, and building the result metadata. What is *not* here is
//! any source-specific meaning — the service never knows what a repository
//! stack is. It hands validated text or JSON back, and the caller's own
//! builder turns that into a `RepositoryContext` or a `ConversationContext`.
//!
//! That split is the whole design. Adding a new analysis should mean writing a
//! prompt, a payload type and a builder — not another capture → normalize →
//! prompt → LLM → parse → persist → provenance pipeline.
