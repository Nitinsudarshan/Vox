//! Correcting a phrase inside a saved note.
//!
//! The whole operation is a deterministic range edit. No model is involved and
//! none should be: the user has already said what the text should be, and
//! regenerating a note through an LLM to perform a substitution would risk
//! changing everything they did not ask about.
//!
//! # Why a range and not a search
//!
//! "Replace the selected occurrence" and "replace every occurrence" are
//! different operations, and a note that says "I opened super base, then super
//! base crashed" makes the difference obvious. The caller sends the character
//! range the user actually selected, so the second occurrence is untouched.
//!
//! # Why the expected text travels with it
//!
//! An offset is only meaningful against the exact content it was measured on.
//! If the note changed between the selection and the save — the full editor was
//! used in another window, a merge landed — those offsets now point somewhere
//! else, and applying them would corrupt text at random. The caller sends what
//! it believes is there and the edit refuses if reality disagrees.
//!
//! # Markdown
//!
//! Nothing here parses Markdown, which is what keeps it safe. The note is
//! stored as Markdown text and the edit is a substring replacement within that
//! text, so a heading stays a heading and a list stays a list — the syntax is
//! never converted to a document model and back.
//!
//! # Why the history is a range and not a snapshot
//!
//! [`CorrectionRecord`] stores the two phrases and where they were, not the
//! note before and after. A range edit is its own inverse — put `original`
//! back where `replacement` now sits — so reversal needs nothing more, and
//! storing whole copies of the note per correction would be a versioning
//! system, which this deliberately is not.
//!
//! Reversing through the range also fails safe. A snapshot undo applied after
//! the full editor touched the note would throw that edit away; reversing the
//! range asks whether `replacement` is still where it was left and refuses
//! when it is not.
