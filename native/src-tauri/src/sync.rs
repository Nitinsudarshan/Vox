//! Poison-tolerant locking.
//!
//! Relay is a long-running desktop recorder: audio capture, the hotkey
//! listener, and the meetings worker all run on their own threads and all
//! reach shared `Mutex` state. `std::sync::Mutex` poisons itself when a
//! thread panics while holding the guard, and every later `lock().unwrap()`
//! on that mutex then panics too. One recoverable panic on a capture thread
//! would therefore take down settings reads, the pill, and the in-progress
//! recording along with it — the user loses a meeting to a fault that had
//! nothing to do with their meeting.
//!
//! `lock_or_recover()` takes the guard through the poison instead. That is a
//! deliberate trade, not a free win: poisoning exists to signal that the
//! protected value may have been left half-updated, and recovering means
//! reading it anyway. It is the right trade *here* because of what these
//! mutexes hold — settings replaced wholesale, an `Option<Session>` handle,
//! sample buffers, cached diagnostics. A torn value in any of those degrades
//! one operation; a poisoned mutex ends the process's usefulness until
//! restart. Something holding an invariant across fields that must not be
//! observed mid-update should not use this, and should say so at its
//! definition.
//!
//! Recovery is never silent — each one logs at `warn` with the call site, so
//! a poisoned lock still shows up as the bug it is.
